That is very possible.

I'm trying for /sys/bus/pci/zpci/uid_checking, I'm using
the below code and the attribute even shows up but reading
it gives me two 0 bytes only.
The relevant code is only a slight alteration of the original patch
as follows:

static ssize_t uid_checking_show(struct bus_type *bus, char *buf)
{
	return sprintf(buf, "%i\n", zpci_unique_uid);
}
static BUS_ATTR_RO(uid_checking);

static struct kset *zpci_global_kset;

static struct attribute *zpci_attrs_global[] = {
	&bus_attr_uid_checking.attr,
	NULL,
};

static struct attribute_group zpci_attr_group_global = {
	.attrs = zpci_attrs_global,
};

int __init zpci_sysfs_init(void)
{
	struct kset *pci_bus_kset;

	pci_bus_kset = bus_get_kset(&pci_bus_type);

	zpci_global_kset = kset_create_and_add("zpci", NULL, &pci_bus_kset->kobj);
	if (!zpci_global_kset)
		return -ENOMEM;

	return sysfs_create_group(&zpci_global_kset->kobj, &zpci_attr_group_global);
}

Understood and thanks for the clear advice!
