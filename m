I see that it is used only for dma-iommu and for PCI devices.
However, I think that should be a problem with other CCA solutions
with emulated devices as they are untrusted. As I'd expect they
would have virtio devices.

Pools can be per-device also. A device can have mutiple pools with
different memory attrs, which then can be matched by the DMA code
at runtime, it's not as flexible, but removes some complexity from
the guest code.

I see, but that’s not part of this series, and probably would require
some rework so dma_capable() can return an error code (ERANGE, EPERM...)
so that caller can deal with that.

I am looking into converting pKVM to use the CC stuff, I replied with
a patch to Aneesh in this thread. However, I need to do more testing
and make sure there are not any unwanted consequences.

I see that's because dma-iommu chooses the attrs for iommu_map().

In pKVM, dma_addr_t and IOPTE are the same for private and shared,
so nothing differs in that case.
We don’t expect pass-through devices to interact with shared
memory (T=0) at the moment.
However, I can see use cases for that, where the host and the guest
collaborate with device passthrough and require zero copy.

One other interesting case for device-passthrough is non-coherent
devices which then require private pools for bouncing.
