I don't think "uid_checking" is quite the right name.  It says
something about the *implementation*, but it doesn't convey what that
*means* to userspace.  IIUC this file tells userspace something about
whether a given PCI device always has the same PCI domain/bus/dev/fn
address (or maybe just the same domain?)

It sounds like this feature could be useful beyond just s390, and
other arches might implement it differently, without the UID concept.
If so, I'm OK with something at the /sys/bus/pci/xxx level as long as
the name is not s390-specific (and "uid" sounds s390-specific).

I assume it would also help with the udev/systemd end if you could
make this less s390 dependent.
