Then this is a requirement of your tooling, not a kernel requirement, not
something the kernel should care about.  QEMU matches devices by their
virtual bus path, not the sysfsdev or host attributes.  In the case of
VF migration with vfio-pci variant drivers we cannot require that the
source and target devices exist at the same bus address.  Ideally the
pre-copy data from the source device to the target will include relevant
configuration information to validate that the source and target are
compatible, regardless of the uuid.

See above, userspace tooling requirements don't imply kernel
requirement.

Something in userspace, perhaps libvirt, is managing the VM.  It needs
to coordinate with a counterpart on another host managing and
configuring the target VM to accept the migration data stream.  There's
likely also another entity that's responsible for deciding this
migration should occur and where to place the target.  All of this is
what I'm referring to as orchestration.

The path of a userspace agent writing into a sysfs attribute to mark
the device as becoming non-migratable so that the host driver can send
an interrupt to the VM to poll an INFO ioctl to block migration is an
over-engineered path at the wrong layer versus some sort of RPC to the
managing process, or even to QEMU, to block migrations.

Additionally, if the device actually itself becomes non-migratable, it
can simply fail any migration state transition other than returning to
RUNNING and can generate errors in the data stream if it needs to abort
an in-progress migration.

This sounds like a userspace orchestration problem, not a kernel
problem.  It might be a valid choice to use the mechanisms I outline
above to abort an in progress migration if a new master key is
configured during migration, but it's not the kernel's problem to
provide a synchronization point for this through the kernel.

Then prevent it in userspace.

If there's a software entity that has the ability to write to sysfs to
declare that a device is not currently available for migration, give it
the ability to notify whatever entity is coordinating and scheduling,
ie. orchestrating, the migration rather than creating a channel through
the device.  Combine that with using the existing mechanisms to abort a
migration if its already in progress.

A userspace interface can still exist, I just don't find this path
through the driver to the VM acceptable with this justification.
Mechanisms already exist for the device to refuse a state transition or
generate an error for a migration already in progress.  IMHO, it would
be acceptable for the device to block a key change if the migration is
already in progress.  If the key change cannot be represented in the
migration data stream, then it's up to the orchestration of the
migration to make sure they stay synchronized, but I don't see that
the vfio uAPI needs to be involved.  Thanks,

Alex
