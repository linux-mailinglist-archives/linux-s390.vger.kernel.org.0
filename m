The semantics are different:

MEMBLOCK_HOTPLUG: memory is indicated as "System RAM" in the 
firmware-provided memory map and added to the system early during boot; 
we want this memory to be managed by ZONE_MOVABLE with "movable_node" 
set on the kernel command line, because only then we want it to be 
hotpluggable again. kexec *has to* indicate this memory to the second 
kernel and can place kexec-images on this memory. After memory 
hotunplug, kexec has to be re-armed.

MEMBLOCK_DRIVER_MANAGED: memory is not indicated as System RAM" in the 
firmware-provided memory map; this memory is always detected and added 
to the system by a driver; memory might not actually be physically 
hotunpluggable and the ZONE selection does not depend on "movable_core". 
kexec *must not* indicate this memory to the second kernel and *must 
not* place kexec-images on this memory.


I would really advise against mixing concepts here.


What we could do is indicate *all* hotplugged memory (not just 
IORESOURCE_SYSRAM_DRIVER_MANAGED memory) as MEMBLOCK_HOTPLUG and make 
MEMBLOCK_HOTPLUG less dependent on "movable_node".

MEMBLOCK_HOTPLUG for early boot memory: with "movable_core", place it in 
ZONE_MOVABLE. Even without "movable_core", don't place early kernel 
allocations on this memory.
MEMBLOCK_HOTPLUG for all memory: don't place kexec images or on this 
memory, independent of "movable_core".


memblock would then not contain the information "contained in 
firmware-provided memory map" vs. "not contained in firmware-provided 
memory map"; but I think right now it's not strictly required to have 
that information if we'd go down that path.

The reasoning is: without "movable_core" we don't want this memory to be 
hotunpluggable; consequently, we don't care if we place kexec-images on 
this memory. MEMBLOCK_HOTPLUG is currently only active with "movable_core".

If we remove that check, we will always not place early kernel 
allocations on that memory, even if we don't care about ZONE_MOVABLE.

I think it depends on how the platform handles hotunpluggable DIMMs or 
hotunpluggable NUMA nodes. If the platform ends up indicates such memory 
via MEMBLOCK_HOTPLUG, and "movable_core" is set, memory would be put 
into ZONE_MOVABLE and kexec would not place kexec-images on that memory.
