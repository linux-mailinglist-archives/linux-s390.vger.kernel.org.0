The allocation is only for the workspace and it does not happen on the
IO path for each call. There's the pool and if

btrfs_get_workspace
  alloc_workspace

fails, then there's fallback path to wait for an existing workspace to
be free.

The order 2 allocation can put more pressure on the allocator though so
it's possible to have effects in some corner cases, but not in general.
I don't think the single page fallback code is needed.

And of course evaluation of the effects of the larger zlib buffer should
be done, it could improve compression but probably at the cost of cpu
time. Also decompression of blocks created on new code (4 pages) must
work on the old code (1 page).
