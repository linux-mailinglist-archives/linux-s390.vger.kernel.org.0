It's too late because we've re-written the error value back to config
space and as a result the device is broken?  What if
pci_restore_state() were a little smarter to detect that it has bad
read data from pci_save_state() and only restores state based on kernel
data?  Would that leave the device in a functional state that
reset_done() could restore the original saved state and push it out to
the device?

Unfortunately I was short sighted on VFIO_DEVICE_RESET and it's the one
ioctl that doesn't have any flags, so it's not very extensible.

Can we do more of the above, ie. enlighten the FLR/PM reset callbacks to
return -ENOTTY if the device is in an error state and config space is
returning -1 such that we fall through to a slot reset that doesn't
care how broken the device is and you auto-magically get the zpci
function you want?  Follow-up with pushing the original state in
reset_done()?  Thanks,

Alex
