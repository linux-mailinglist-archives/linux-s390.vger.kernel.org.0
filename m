no, there are no other users of arch_kexec_do_relocs other than
kexec_file and kaslr at the moment.

=46rom a technical perspective your patch was totally fine for todays
use cases. My concern was more for a potential future user. But maybe I
was a little bit overcautious...=20

IIUC, the culprit is the '-r' option in the LDFLAGS. With this option
the output can be used again as input _for ld_. The way I interpret
this is that ld can (and apparently does) use any internal convention
without complying with the ABI when this option is given.

kaslr doesn't use '-r' but a combination of -fPIE (CFLAGS) and -pie
(LDFLAGS) so they are not affected by ld's internal behavior. Maybe
it's worth investigating in the long run if the purgatory could be build
with -fPIE/-pie as well.

Thanks
Philipp
