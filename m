You are right. There is a change and we do not unregister the subchannel if we
find the corresponding device is not operational or empty.

Yes. But, this is in case of actual device. I just defined around 5k virtual
dasd devices on zVM and did not enable them. i.e those subchannels are not
blacklisted anymore, but they does not have an operational device. 

other than zVM, other than testing this patch on different available LPARs,
we tried to mimic the device availability with a custom test-kernel.
Basically, modified the subchannel initialization code and inform the subchannel
about the presence of a device, which then later fails during SNSID.
It is a horrid way to test it, but i think it could simulate some LPARs with
more than 1000 non-operational devices connected on it.

Thanks. Most of my tests were on IO-subchannel. I shall try few tests on CHSC
and EADM.

I have done couple of tests with driverctl. Also, i was wondering if vfio-ccw
can make use of 'dev_busid' sysfs-interface under each subchannels while writing
the rules. This is totally different topic, which i do not want to mix up in
this thread.
