The reason why THP migration cannot work on s390 is because the migration
code will establish swap ptes in a pmd. The pmd layout is very different from
the pte layout on s390, so you cannot simply write a swap pte into a pmd.
There are no separate swp primitives for swap/migration pmds, IIRC. And even
if there were, we'd still need to find some space for a present bit in the
s390 pmd, and/or possibly move around some other bits.

A lot of things can go wrong here, even if it could be possible in theory,
by introducing separate swp primitives in common code for pmd entries, along
with separate offset, type, shift, etc. I don't see that happening in the
near future.

Not sure if this is a show stopper, but I am not familiar enough with
NUMA and migration code to judge. E.g., I do not see any swp entry action
in your patches, but I assume this is implicitly triggered by the switch
to generic THP migration code.

Could there be a work-around by splitting THP pages instead of marking them
as migrate pmds (via pte swap entries), at least when THP migration is not
supported? I guess it could also be acceptable if THP pages were simply not
migrated for NUMA balancing on s390, but then we might need some extra config
option to make that behavior explicit.

See also my comment on patch #5 of this series.

Gerald
