"Free the memory of an exiting process" implies all memory, not just
anonymous. User cannot know it will free only anonymous, and I am trying to
make it work as intended by completing a symmetric reclamation path.

I am trying to isolate the new behavior under the new flag on
process_mrelease. What about this? (Need more changes from previous
feedbacks but it would be enough to show intention)

Subject: [PATCH] mm: process_mrelease: skip LRU movement and expedite clean
 file folio reclaim

During process_mrelease(), unmapping file-backed folios spends a
significant portion of CPU time in folio_mark_accessed() to maintain
accurate LRU state (~55% of unmap time). Furthermore, clean file folios
are left in the page cache, delaying their reclamation.

This patch bundles two optimizations targeting exclusive file folios
during such emergency memory reclaim:
1. Skips LRU handling for exclusive file folios in zap_present_folio_ptes()
   to save CPU time.
2. Proactively evicts clean file folios in free_pages_and_caches() to free
   up memory quickly.

To avoid polluting mm/swap_state.c (which deals purely with swap) with file
cache eviction logic, we replace free_pages_and_swap_cache() with a more
generic free_pages_and_caches() in mm/swap.c where the file eviction helper
is defined.

[Side Effects & Rationale]
A concern raised during discussion is that skipping LRU handling effectively
breaks aging for exclusively mapped file pages that might have otherwise been
activated. This implies that if the victim process is immediately restarted,
it may suffer from cache misses and refaults because its files were not
preserved in the active state.

It was also noted during discussion that if avoiding LRU movement and
evicting cache negatively affects the workflow (due to immediate restart), it
implies a sub-optimal kill target selection by the userspace policy (e.g.,
LMKD), rather than a flaw in this expedited reclamation mechanism. Userspace
is expected to use this targeted reclaim API for victims that are not
expected to restart soon.

One might argue that standard memory reclaim by kswapd under heavy pressure
would have already encountered these pages and aged them accordingly. However,
this may not always be the case and ultimately depends on timing. We cannot
reliably predict whether kswapd has processed them, nor can we know the future
access patterns of a dying process.

Therefore, process_mrelease() is an emergency operation triggered under
extreme memory pressure. In these scenarios, recovering memory as quickly as
possible is the highest priority to avoid further kills or system jank.
Spending half of the unmap time on LRU maintenance for pages belonging to a
victim process is a bad trade-off. We prioritize immediate CPU savings and
faster memory recovery over potential future cache hits for the victim's files.

Fundamentally, anonymous pages are already freed immediately during process
termination because they cannot be preserved. This patch makes the behavior for
exclusive file-backed pages consistent by proactively evicting them, completing
a symmetric and expedited reclamation path for both types of memory.

To handle shared address spaces safely and protect existing users from behavior
changes, these optimizations are restricted to only when the new flag
PROCESS_MRELEASE_REAP_KILL is used. We pass the signal down via
zap_details->ignore_access for the unmap path, and via a new flag on struct
mmu_gather for the freeing path.

This provides deterministic and synchronous memory recovery that userspace
killers like Android's LMKD rely on, while protecting normal workloads from
broken aging.
