Hey Niklas et al. :)

I think this will need input from Greg. He should be best versed in
sysfs attributes. The problem with KERNEL_ATTR_* to me seems that it's
supposed to be kernel internal. Now, that might just be a matter of
renaming the macro but let's see whether Greg has any better idea or
more questions. :)
