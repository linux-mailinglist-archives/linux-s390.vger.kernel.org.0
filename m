If the kernel gets support for s390x user space unwinding using the backchain,
we'll propose to enable -mbackchain in the default compilation flags for Fedora
so that s390x on Fedora will have the same profiling experience as x86-64, arm64
and ppc64. For now we'll keep the status quo since compiling with the backchain
doesn't provide any benefit until the kernel unwinder can unwind user
space stacks
using it.

Thanks for clarifying the current state of user space stack unwinding on s390x!

Cheers,

Daan
