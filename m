Let's consider part 3 only and ignore the 1) multi freearea (which might 
be problematic with sparcity) and 2) the modified allocation scheme 
(which doesn't yet quite sense to me yet, e.g., because we group by 
mobility and have compaction in place; I assume this really only helps 
in some special cases -- like the test case you are giving; I might be 
wrong)

Right now, we decide whether to but to head or tail based on how likely 
it is that we might merge to a higher-order page (buddy_merge_likely()) 
in the future. So we only consider the current "neighborhood" of the 
page we're freeing. As we restrict our neighborhood to MAX_ORDER - 1 
pages (what we can actually merge). Of course, we can easily be wrong 
here. Grouping by movability and compaction only helps to some degree I 
guess.

AFAIK, what you propose is basing the decisions where to place a page 
(in addition?) on a median_pfn. Without 1) and 2) I cannot completely 
understand if 3) itself would help at all (and how to set the 
median_pfn). But it would certainly be interesting if we can tweak the 
current logic to better identify merge targets simply by tweaking 
buddy_merge_likely() or the assumptions it is making.
