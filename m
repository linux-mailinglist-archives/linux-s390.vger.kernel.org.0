Verified with DCSS overlapping boot and standby memory, works fine.
As expected, the error message changes, but I don't think that is a
problem, as long as you also remove the old -ENOSPC case / comment
in arch/s390/mm/extmem.c. It is actually more correct now I guess,
-ENOSPC doesn't look like the correct return value anyway.

Thanks for cleaning up! Looks good to me, and removes > 100 LOC,
unless Heiko remembers some other issues from ancient times.
