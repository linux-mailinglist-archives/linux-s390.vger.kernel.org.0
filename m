Good catch, thanks!

There doesn't seem to be a precedent for arch specific attributes under
/sys/bus/pci so I went with a separate group for the RFC.
"zpci" since that's what we've been calling the s390 specific PCI.
I'm not attached to that name or having a separate group, from
my perspective /sys/bus/pci/unique_uids would actually be ideal
if Bjorn is okay with that, we don't currently foresee any additional
global attributes and no one else seems to have them but
one never knows and a separate group would then of course,
well group them.

If this attribute is 0 multiple PCI devices seen by Linux may have the same UID i.e.
they may collide with each other on the same Linux instance. The
UIDs are exposed under /sys/bus/pci/devices/<dev>/uid. Even if the attribute is 1
multiple Linux instances will often see the same UID. The main use case
we currently envision is naming PCI based network interfaces "eno<UID>"
which of course only works if the UIDs are unique for that Linux.
On the same mainframe multiple Linux instances may then e.g. use the same
UID for VFs from the same physical PCI network card or different cards
but the same physical network all defined by an administrator/management
system.

The UIDs come from the platform/firmware/hypervisor and are provided
for each device by the CLP List PCI Functions "instruction" that is used
on s390x where an OS can't probe the physical PCI bus but instead
that is done by firmware. On QEMU/KVM they can be set on the QEMU cli,
on our machine hypervisor they are defined by the machine administrator/management
software as part of the definition of VMs/Partitions on that mainframe which includes
everything from the number of CPUs, memory, I/O devices etc. With the exposed UID uniqueness
attribute the platform then certifies that it will ensure that a UID is set to
a unique non-zero value. I can of course add more of this explanation
in the documentation too.

Both the uniqueness guarantee (this attribute) as well as the UIDs themselves
are part of the Z (s390x) architecture so fall under the mainframe typical
backwards compatibility considerations.

Thanks,
Niklas
