I really don't think this is QEMU related. The test fails are sort of
expected: we've seen KCSAN reports when the kernel boots and wanted to
fix them later.
However I have to admit that I wasn't aware of the KCSAN KUNIT tests,
and wouldn't have sent the s390 KCSAN enablement upstream if I would
have been aware of failing self tests.

We'll fix them, and I let you know if things are supposed to work.

Thanks a lot for making aware of this!
