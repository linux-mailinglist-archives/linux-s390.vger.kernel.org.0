Where whether a device is opened is subject to change outside of the
user's control.  This essentially allows the user to perform hot-resets
of devices outside of their ownership so long as the device is not
used elsewhere, versus the current requirement that the user own all the
affected groups, which implies device ownership.  It's not been
justified why this feature needs to exist, imo.

The "only supposed to be used" is problematic here, we're extending all
the interfaces to transparently accept group and device fds, but here
we need to make a distinction because the ioctl needs to perform one
way for groups and another way for devices, which it currently doesn't
do.  As above, I've not seen sufficient justification for this other
than references to reducing complexity, but the only userspace expected
to make use of this interface already has equivalent complexity.

Again, what is the justification for requiring this, it seems to be
only a hack towards no-iommu support with cdev, which we can achieve by
other means.  Why have we not needed this in the group model?  It
introduces subtle loopholes, so while maybe we could, I don't see why we
should, therefore I cannot agree with "this makes sense".

I think this is fundamentally flawed because of the scope of the
dev-id.  We can only provide dev-ids for devices which belong to the
same iommufd of the calling device, thus there are multiple instances
where no dev-id can be provided.  The group-id and bdf are static
properties of the devices, regardless of their ownership.  The bdf
provides the specific device level association while the group-id
indicates implied, static ownership.

As above, I think 2) is also an issue.

The group association is that relaxed ownership test.  Yes, there are
corner cases where we have a dual function card with separate IOMMU
groups, where a user owning function 0 could do a bus reset because
function 1 is temporarily unused, but so what, what good is that, have
we ever had an issue raised because of this?  The user can't rely on
the unopened state of the other function.  It's an entirely
opportunistic optimization.

The much more typical scenario is that a multi-function device does not
provide isolation, all the functions are in the same group and because
of the association of the group the user has implied ownership of the
other devices for the purpose of a reset.

As above, this seems to be some optimization related to no-iommu for
cdev because we don't have an iommufd association for the device in
no-iommu mode.  Note however that the current group interface doesn't
care about the IOMMU context of the devices.  We only need proof that
the user owns the affected groups.  So why are we bringing iommufd
context anywhere into this interface, here or the null-array interface?

It seems like the minor difference with cdev is that a) we're passing
device fds rather than group fds, and b) those device fds need to be
validated as having device access to complete the proof of ownership
relative to the group.  Otherwise we add capabilities to
DEVICE_GET_INFO to support the device fd passing model where the user
doesn't know the device group or bdf and allow the reset ioctl itself
to accept device fds (extracting the group relationship for those which
the user has configured for access).  Thanks,

Alex
