To properly support async algorithms, the users (e.g. dm-integrity and
dm-verity) really would need to have separate code paths anyway.  The
computation models are just too different.

But in this case, it seems you simply want it to be synchronous and use virtual
addresses.  The quirks of ahash, including its need for per-request allocations
and scatterlists, make it a poor match here.  The only thing you are getting
with it is, ironically, that it allows you to wait synchronously.  That could be
done with shash too if it was fixed to support algorithms that aren't atomic.
E.g. there could be a new CRYPTO_ALG_MAY_SLEEP flag that could be set in struct
shash_alg to indicate that the algorithm doesn't support atomic context, and a
flag could be passed to crypto_alloc_shash() to allow such an algorithm to be
selected (if the particular user never uses it in atomic context).

That would be faster and simpler than the proposed ahash based version.
