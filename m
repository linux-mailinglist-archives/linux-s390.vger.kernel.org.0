Based upon my observations of the behavior during a removal
of the mdev, memory is not leaked. If the fd for the mdev is
open when an attempt is made to remove it, the operation
will hang until the mdev fd is closed which happens when
either the guest is shut down or the mdev device is detached from
the guest. When the fd is closed, the mdev release callback is
invoked which nullifies the KVM pointer, so when the remove callback
is subsequently invoked, the mdev resources will be cleaned up.
Of course, I imagine there are other possibilities
for how an mdev can be removed, but in the normal course of
events, memory will not be leaked.

That may be true with other devices, but the matrix device is
not a real, physical device. Its sole purpose in life is to provide
an anchor for the mdev devices used to provide AP resources
to a guest; however, I get your point.
