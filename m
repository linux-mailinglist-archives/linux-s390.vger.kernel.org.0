7821, hugetlb.c  
7602, vmscan.c          
7275, slub.c       
7072, page_alloc.c
6673, memory.c     
5402, memcontrol.c 
5239, shmem.c

4419, filemap.c       
4060, mmap.c       
3882, huge_memory.c

IMHO a split is normally better than keeping everything in one file, but
yeah I'd confess THP file isn't that bad comparing to others..  And I'm
definitely surprised it's even out of top ten.

Right, I had a patch does exactly that, where it's called pmd_is_leaf(),
for example, but taking CONFIG_* into account.

I remember I had some issue with that, e.g. I used to see pmd_trans_huge()
(when !THP) can optimize some path but pmd_is_leaf() didn't do the same job
even if all configs were off.  But that's another story and I didn't yet
dig deeper.  Could be something small but overlooked.

Yeah comments are always welcomed, thanks.

So I suppose maybe it would be easier for now that I make the pfnmap branch
depending on THP. It looks to me something like this may still take some
time to consolidate.  When it's light enough, maybe it can be a few initial
patches on top of a hugetlb series that can start to use this.  Maybe
that'll at least make the patches easier to review.

Thanks,
