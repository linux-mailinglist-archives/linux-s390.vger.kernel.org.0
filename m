Either that, or state in the cover letter that those are prerequisites.

This does not answer my questions.

I'm in favor of Jason's proposal, because it is much easier to
comprehend simple rwsem protected than a mutex + wait_queue dance. 

I think Jason was talking about open coding locks in general. I don't
consider it as proof of commit 0cc00c8d4050 not doing what it
advertised. You can add a Suggested-by tag if you like, but you should
be able to tell us what is the merit of your patch.
