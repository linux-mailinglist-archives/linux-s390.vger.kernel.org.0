This doesn't exist.

I think there's more than hope involved here, there are recipes to
create working hot-reset configurations because it is well specified
and predictable currently.  QEMU can indicate whether hot-reset is
available thanks to the information provided in the INFO ioctl and a VM
that owns the necessary set of groups may consistently and repeatedly
perform hot-resets.

hw/vfio/pci.c:2320
        error_report("vfio: Cannot reset device %s, "
                     "depends on group %d which is not owned.",
                     vdev->vbasedev.name, devices[i].group_id);

That creates a feedback loop where a user can take corrective action
with actual information in hand to resolve the issue.

So on one hand you're asking for simplicity, but on the other you're
criticizing a trivial simplification that we chose to allow the user to
pass number of group fds equal to number of devices affected so that
the user doesn't need to take that step to de-duplicate the list.  We
can't win.

But dev-id only has meaning in relation to an iommufd_ctx, so it fails
to be useful in the context of implied ownership.

As discussed ad nauseam, dev-id is useless if an affected device is not
already within the iommufd ctx.  BDF provides a mapping to specific
affected devices, but can't express implied ownership.  Group id
provides the implied ownership, but can't express specific devices.  As
Yi has pointed out, QEMU needs to know both if it has ownership of all
the affected devices, both direct and implied, and which specific
devices that it owns are affected.

It's not been shown to me that dev-id is a useful replacement for
anything here.

That is super sketchy because you're also advocating for
opportunistically supporting reset if the instantaneous conditions
allow is (ex. unopened devices), and going back and forth whether "ask
it to keep working" suggests that a user is able to extend their
granted ownership themselves.  I think both needs to be based on some
form of granted, not requested, ownership and not opportunism.

> #3 is either INFO and a CAP for BDF or INFO2 reporting dev_id

Where dev-id is useful for... ?  I think there's a misuse of "groups"
in 3) above, userspace needs to know specific devices affected, thus
BDF.

We can't assume that all the affected devices are bound to vfio,
therefore we cannot assume a vfio_device IDR exists.

"...doesn't need the information to figure out what the list actually
is."  That's false, userspace needs the information whether it uses it
to make a list or not, ex. pre- and post-reset processing of specific
affected devices.  Furthermore, supporting a zero length array removes
context from the existing ioctl, which has been shown to make it prone
to creating gaps in legacy group use cases, so I don't understand why
this optimization is so pervasive or important.

So what is the exact proposal?  We can't have an INFO ioctl that simply
returns error if the ownership requirements are not met as that doesn't
support 4).  So we need one or more ioctls that a) indicates whether
the ownership requirements are met and b) indicates the set of affected
devices.  Is b) only the set of affected devices within the calling
devices iommufd_ctx (ie. dev-ids), in which case we need c) a way to
report the overall set of affected devices regardless of ownership in
support of 4), BDF?

Are we back to replacing group-ids with dev-ids in the INFO structure,
where an invalid dev-id either indicates an affected device with
implied ownership (ok) or a gap in ownership (bad) and a flag somewhere
is meant to indicate the overall disposition based on the availability
of reset?  I'm not sure how that fully supports 4) since the user can't
determine if a given invalid dev-id is in fact a blocker, so do we end
up with multiple invalid IDs, perhaps one to indicate unknown but ok
and another to indicate an ownership gap?  Are devices outside of the
iommufd_ctx, but with implied ownership via group omitted entirely from
the lists?  I think we need an actual proposal here.  Thanks,

Alex
