Sure.  But I'll wait a bit to see if there are any other comments first.

I don't really have time at the moment.  Nor am I particularly familiar wi=
th
the optimised asm instructions for this on any arch.

Sure.  The hash algos do love talking in terms of bits.  Possibly because
bytes aren't necessarily 8 bits in size on all arches?

"Context" as in?

Yes, I'm aware of that.  The hash-test-template template is rather rigid a=
nd
not always correct in its assertions (for instance requiring the final
function to have zeroed the context - I had to modify my API to work aroun=
d
the testsuite).

I disagree.  It should have at least a single self-test.  If we fail to lo=
ad
any modules because the hash is broken on a particular CPU, it would be us=
eful
to have a note in dmesg.  Loading kunit test modules becomes tricky in suc=
h a
case.

Yes, but I believe you wanted me to use hash-test-template.  The problem i=
s
that it hard-encodes by macroisation of the #include's file various parame=
ters
including the hash size.

I could do that.  It would at least exercise the common engine.

Possibly all 5 different block sizes employed (128, 224, 256, 384 and 512)
need to be so tested - but that only affects how much of the state array i=
s
modified directly sha3_update() and how much can be extracted from by
sha3_squeeze().  The actual keccak mixing function doesn't care.

Other than that, the only differences between the algorithms are the paddi=
ng
char and how much digest is extracted by default.

On top of that, you can have a variety of different usage sequences: diffe=
rent
sequences of updating and squeezing with different amounts of data added a=
nd
extracted.  I wonder if a small sampling is sufficient or whether we need =
some
loopy thing that tries to exhaustively test a portion of the sample space.
