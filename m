Yes you're right, in fact we internally also started to think about
something more meaning oriented like "unique_uids". This indeed results
in PCI addresses which can be relied upon as stable identifiers. For us
it's enough that the domain matches as the bus is always 0 and
dev/fn are determined by the device and SR-IOV stride etc.
so will remain the same for equivalent configurations.

That's a very good point! I'm absolutely open to making this a
common concept. I think the gist could be that the addressing/ids on
the bus are reproducible, there might be some user configuration
required but then they can be relied upon for stable names like
network interfaces. So maybe a name like "reproducible_addressing"?
I guess one non-s390 exclusive case of this could be virtualized
PCI under QEMU/KVM etc. versus real hardware or even UEFI/Firmware
guarantees, right?
