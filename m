My concern with exposing the entire struct zpci_ccdf_err was it could be 
error prone trying to keep the struct and vfio uAPI struct in sync. Just 
thinking out loud, to query the length we would need a different vfio 
device feature bit? But if it makes for a better uAPI, I can make the 
change. Thanks
