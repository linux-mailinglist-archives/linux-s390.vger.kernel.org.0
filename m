Well, it's not exactly useless -- userspace gets notified that the
device has bound to a driver, which was an information that was
completely missing up to now for subchannels. The main issue is that the
subchannel will get deregistered again (or has that been changed? Sorry,
I've been out of the loop for too long...)

I think the potentially problematic case is "lots of I/O subchannels
with no valid device", and I think you can't get that under z/VM (which
will not give you those subchannels in the first place), but only on LPAR.

I would probably also verify:
- non-I/O subchannels (IIRC you can't have CHSC subchannels under z/VM,
  don't know about EADM, so that would need to be done on an LPAR as
  well)
- interaction with driverctl (and maybe mdevctl) for vfio-ccw

But I think I also may be a bit out of touch here :)
