Ok, we'll look into this.

Our most important driver is mlx5 with both IP and RDMA traffic on
ConnectX-4/5/6 but we also support NVMes.

The lazy flushes are the timer triggered flush_iotlb_all() in
fq_flush_iotlb(), right? I definitely see that when tracing my
flush_iotlb_all() implementation via that path. That flush_iotlb_all()
in my prototype is basically the same as the global RPCIT we did once
we wrapped around our IOVA address space. I suspect that this just
happens much more often with the timer than our wrap around and
flushing the entire aperture is somewhat slow because it causes the
hypervisor to re-examine the entire I/O translation table. On the other
hand in strict mode the iommu_iotlb_sync() call in __iommu_unmap()
always flushes a relatively small contiguous range as I'm using the
following construct to extend gather:

	if (iommu_iotlb_gather_is_disjoint(gather, iova, size))
		iommu_iotlb_sync(domain, gather);

	iommu_iotlb_gather_add_range(gather, iova, size);

Maybe the smaller contiguous ranges just help with locality/caching
because the flushed range in the guests I/O tables was just updated.
