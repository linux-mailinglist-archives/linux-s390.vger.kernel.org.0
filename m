Sounds good.

One thing to note is that this approach is still not perfect, as some sibling
processes sharing the mm might not be killed due to different UID or SELinux
policies while others are. In such cases, the actual memory reaping via
process_mrelease() will still fail anyway.

If we are okay with this limitation - meaning it acts as a best-effort
approach where we might end up killing some processes without successfully
releasing the memory — then I can proceed with this design.

Okay, let's wait for any valid reasons or concerns they might raise.

Thanks.
