Sure, good point. So first off yes this change does create new index
based names also on existing systemd versions, this is known and
intended and we'll certainly closely collaborate with any distributions
wishing to backport this change.

As for being otherwise safe or having unintended consequences, Viktor
(see R-b) and I recently got the following PR merged in that exact area
of systemd to fix how hotplug slot derived interface names are
generated:
https://github.com/systemd/systemd/pull/19017
In working on that we did also analyse the use of the index attribute
for hidden assumptions and tested with this attribute added. Arguably,
as the nature of that PR shows we haven't had a perfect track record of
keeping this monitored but will in the future as PCI based NICs become
increasingly important for our platform. We also have special NIC
naming logic in the same area for our channel based platform specific
NICs which was also contributed by Viktor.

Thanks,
Niklas
