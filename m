ok so that's a QEMU bug. Any virtio 1.0 and up
compatible device must use LE.
It can also present a legacy config space where the
endian depends on the guest.

Yes, the modern driver does. And that one is known to be LE.
legacy driver doesn't.

Because of a qemu bug. I agree. It's worth working around in the driver
since the qemu bug has been around for a very long time.

Because the spec is very clear that endian-ness is LE.
I don't see a spec issue yet here, just an implementation issue.

Because QEMU ignores the spec and instead relies on the feature
negotiation.

The problem is in the guest. The bug is in the host ;)

Well no, the point of transitional is really to be 1.0 compliant
*and* also expose a legacy interface.

OK so. I don't have a problem with the patch itself,
assuming it's enough to work around all buggy hosts.
I am especially worried about things like vhost/vhost-user,
I suspect they might have a bug like this too, and
I am not sure whether your work around is enough for these.
Can you check please?

If not we'll have to move all validate code to after FEATURES_OK
is set.

We do however want to document that this API can be called
multiple times since that was not the case
previously.

Also, I would limit this to when
- the validate callback exists
- the guest endian-ness is not LE

We also want to document the QEMU bug in a comment here,
e.g. 

/*
 * QEMU before version 6.2 incorrectly uses driver features with guest
 * endian-ness to set endian-ness for config space instead of just using
 * LE for the modern interface as per spec.
 * This breaks reading config in the validate callback.
 * To work around that, when device is 1.0 (so supposed to be LE)
 * but guest is not LE, then send the features to device one extra
 * time before validation.
 */

Finally I'd like to see the QEMU bug fix before I merge this one,
since it will be harder to test with a fix.
