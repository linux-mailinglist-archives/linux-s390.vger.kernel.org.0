Yes, S390 uses appended signature, but they also do not support 
measurements.

On the other hand for arm64/x86, PECOFF works only with KEXEC_SIG. Look 
at the KEXEC_IMAGE_VERIFY_SIG config dependencies in arch/arm64/Kconfig 
and KEXEC_BZIMAGE_VERIFY_SIG config dependencies in arch/x86/Kconfig. 
Now, if KEXEC_SIG is not enabled, then IMA appraisal policies are 
enforced if secure boot is enabled, refer to 
security/integrity/ima_efi.c . IMA would fail verification if kernel is 
not signed with module sig appended signatures or signature verification 
fails.

In short, IMA is used to enforce the existence of a policy if secure 
boot is enabled. If they don't support module sig appended signatures, 
by definition it fails. Thus PECOFF doesn't work with both KEXEC_SIG and 
IMA_KEXEC, but only with KEXEC_SIG.

Lakshmi, do you agree with my reasoning ?

I am unsure what do you mean by "complex code" here. Can you please 
elaborate ? IMA policies support for secureboot already exists and can 
be used as it is without adding any extra work as in 
arch/powerpc/kernel/ima_arch.c.

Also, if my analysis is right, I think I understand arm64/x86 support 
for both KEXEC_SIG and IMA_KEXEC as it can support two signature formats 
- PECOFF/module sig appended signature.

I am not clear from the patch descriptions on the need to add KEXEC_SIG 
support on POWER when that will also be based on module sig appended 
signatures like IMA_KEXEC.

Thanks & Regards,
