I guess the '\n' handling is customary, and is what the same what
the pci counterpart (782a985d7af2) does anyway. It bothers
me a little that you don't necessarily get back from with show
what you stored. E.g. # echo -e "bug\nfree"
> /sys/bus/css/devices/0.0.0001/driver_override # echo $?
0
# cat /sys/bus/css/devices/0.0.0001/driver_override
bug
# echo $?
0
But given the previous art (782a985d7af2) I think it is the best way
to do it.

The rest is very straightforward.

Interesting. I hope to get around and have a closer look at it
eventually.
