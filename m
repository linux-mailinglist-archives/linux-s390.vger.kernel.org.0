Uh, good catch. I was actually looking suspiciously at how we cast signed to
unsigned, but didn't occur to me that shortening together with endiannes is
the problem.

With all this experience I'm now inclined to rather follow more the example
in Documentation/filesystems/seq_file.rst and don't pass around the pointer
that we got as ppos in slab_debugfs_start(), and that seq_file.c points to
m->index.

In that example an own value is kmalloced:

loff_t *spos = kmalloc(sizeof(loff_t), GFP_KERNEL);

while we could just make this a field of loc_track?

I guess we don't.
