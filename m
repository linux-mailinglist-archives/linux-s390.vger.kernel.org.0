Not quite; if the last ref is put, it invokes the provided ->release
callback and frees the allocated name. If the ->release callback does
not free the object embedding the kobject, only the name is freed
AFAICS.

I might be confused by the path revalidation logic; but don't you unset
in_sysfs when you remove the path object? What happens when you readd it?

If the kset could not be set up during init, you'll hit this for every
path object you want to add afterwards -- one warning per device of
that should be enough, I guess :)

Yes, but the kobject code does not unset state_initialized.

Yes, avoiding freeing and reallocating memory certainly makes sense.

Yes, there doesn't seem to be any memory leakage.

I understand where you're coming from.

However, "static" kobjects (in the sense of "we may re-register the
same kobject") are still problematic. Is there any way to simply
"disappear" path objects that are not valid at the moment, or mark them
as not valid?

Also, the simple act of registering/unregistering a kobject already
creates stress from its sysfs interactions... it seems you should try
to avoid that as well?
