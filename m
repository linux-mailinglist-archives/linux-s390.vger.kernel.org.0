Yes, it looks to me it's better to do that in virtio_set_features_nocheck=

Yes.

Good point. I think it was probably wrong to tie F_IOMMU_PLATFORM to=20
IOTLB API. Technically IOTLB can work with GPA->HVA mapping. I=20
originally use a dedicated feature bit (you can see that from commit=20
log), but for some reason Michael tweak it to virtio feature bit. I=20
guess it was probably because at that time there's no way to specify e.g=20
backend capability but now we have VHOST_GET_BACKEND_FEATURES.

For now, it was probably too late to fix that but document or we can add=20
the support of enabling IOTLB via new backend features.

Yes, I aggree that we should decouple the features that does not belongs=20
to device (protected, encrypted, swiotlb etc) from F_IOMMU_PLATFORM. But=20
Michael and other have their points as well.

Thanks
