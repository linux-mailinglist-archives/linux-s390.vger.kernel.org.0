Hi Linus,

Thank you for looking into this issue and sharing your thoughts.

Regarding proc_mem_open(), it actually operates very close to what you suggested.
It acquires a reference to the mm_struct itself via mmgrab() but immediately
unpins the address space memory via mmput(). Thus, no long-term mm_users
reference is held across the open file descriptor.

The latency issue occurs during seqfile iteration (m_start/m_stop) in
smaps/maps, or during get_cmdline() and ptrace_access_vm(), where the reader
temporarily acquires mm_users via mmget_not_zero() or get_task_mm().

Because these monitoring processes or background readers often run with lower
priority on heavily loaded systems under memory pressure, their temporary
mmget() reference can easily be delayed or preempted for extended periods.

When the victim process exits, its memory teardown (exit_mmap) is blocked by
this stalled reference. Because any kernel interface acquiring mmget() can
potentially cause this delay under heavy load, the issue appears more general
than just a single file interface.

This is why I felt allowing process_mrelease() to directly acquire the dying
address space could be a clean and robust way to resolve this expedited reclaim
issue, without modifying individual callers across the kernel. I would highly
appreciate your thoughts on this perspective.
