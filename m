Oh no I definitely don't want to put any naming in the kernel.
Rather this is very much "a thing that the hardware knows".
The thing being:

  We're a virtual platform and this PCI devices' address is generated
  from user configuration and we guarantee it's stable.

Yes I assumed as much which is why my examples were all about virtualized
platforms/hypervisors. I would say QEMU very much knows if the PCI address
is coming from its fluffy virtual sandbox or real wild hardware (pass-through).

Well as said above, at the very least there is real hardware, emulated
hardware and our always virtualizing machines that keep things cozy
and reliable enough that you can keep running OSs from the 70s largely
unchanged on >5 GHz CPUs. So I think at least our platform has a pretty
good track record in this regard.
