Which is fine as "normally" that does not change.  But on some machines,
it is quite volatile so users pick a different naming scheme.

And this is all done in userspace, I really don't understand what you
want to do in the kernel here.  If you want to expose another unique
thing that the hardware knows about, wonderful, userspace can then use
that if it wants to in how it names specific devices.  But don't put
that naming in the kernel, that's not where it belongs.

The platform does not "know" if this is reliable or not, sorry.  That's
not how PCI or UEFI works.

Because for the most part, yes, this works.  Until you plug another
device into the system.  Or remove one.  Or plug a hotplug device in and
then cold boot with it plugged in (or removed).  Or, my favorite system,
just decide to renumber the PCI bus every other boot "just because".

None of that variability can be known by the kernel, that's only known by
the user of that system, so again, they can make the best decision as to
how to name their devices.  If you want to use the systemd default,
wonderful, but know that it does not work for everyone, so systemd
allows you to do whatever you want.

There is no reliability "score" here, sorry.  Hardware is fun :)

good luck!
