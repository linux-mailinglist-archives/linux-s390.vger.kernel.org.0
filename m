Personally I don't like the suggestion to fail with -EPERM if the user
doesn't own all the affected devices.  This isn't a "probe if I can do
a reset" ioctl, it's a "provide information about the devices affected
by a reset to know how to call the hot-reset ioctl".  We're returning
the bdf to the cdev version of this ioctl for exactly this debugging
purpose when the devices are not owned, that becomes useless if we give
up an return -EPERM if ownership doesn't align.

Yes, it could be argued that the group-id itself is superfluous, the
user can determine the group via the bdf, but it also aligns with the
hot-reset ioctl, which currently requires the group fd.  Thanks,
