Gently ping.

I also did some tests to measure the latency of do_huge_pmd_numa_page.
The test VM has 80 vcpus and 64G memory. The test would create 2
processes to consume 128G memory together which would incur memory
pressure to cause THP splits. And it also creates 80 processes to hog
cpu, and the memory consumer processes are bound to different nodes
periodically in order to increase NUMA faults.

The below test script is used:

echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches

# Run stress-ng for 24 hours
./stress-ng/stress-ng --vm 2 --vm-bytes 64G --timeout 24h &
PID=$!

./stress-ng/stress-ng --cpu $NR_CPUS --timeout 24h &

# Wait for vm stressors forked
sleep 5

PID_1=`pgrep -P $PID | awk 'NR == 1'`
PID_2=`pgrep -P $PID | awk 'NR == 2'`

JOB1=`pgrep -P $PID_1`
JOB2=`pgrep -P $PID_2`

# Bind load jobs to different nodes periodically to force generate
# cross node memory access
while [ -d "/proc/$PID" ]
do
        taskset -apc 8 $JOB1
        taskset -apc 8 $JOB2
        sleep 300
        taskset -apc 58 $JOB1
        taskset -apc 58 $JOB2
        sleep 300
done

With the above test the histogram of latency of do_huge_pmd_numa_page
is as shown below. Since the number of do_huge_pmd_numa_page varies
drastically for each run (should be due to scheduler), so I converted
the raw number to percentage.

Per the result, patched kernel is even slightly better than the base
kernel. I think this is because the lock contention against THP split
is less than base kernel due to the refactor.


To exclude the affect from THP split, I also did test w/o memory
pressure. No obvious regression is spotted. The below is the test
result *w/o* memory pressure.
