transitional devices can be accessed through a modern
or a legacy interface, not both. Device knows how
it's accessed. It should key endian-ness decisions on
this not on feature negotiation.

That's ok, my point is that revision is negotiated before config
accesses, IIUC a legacy driver expecting BE will use revision 0, modern
one will use revision 1 and up.

Version === legacy versus modern?
It is true that feature negotiation can not be used by device to decide that
question simply because it happens too late.
So let's not use it for that then ;)

Yes we have VERSION_1 which looks like it should allow this, but
unfortunately it only helps with that for the driver, not the device.

In practice legacy versus modern has to be determined by
transport specific versioning, luckily we have that for all
specified transports (can't say what happens with rproc).
