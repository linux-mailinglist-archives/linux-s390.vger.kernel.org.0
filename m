Are you suggesting to change the struct io_tlb_mem::cc_shared back to
struct io_tlb_mem::unencrypted?. If we want to split cc_shared and
unencrypted as two flags, I think we will add quiet a lot of code
duplication.

If by low DMA address you mean using an address with the C-bit
cleared. Currently the SME code uses force_dma_unencrypted() as the hook to
determine whether the C-bit needs to be cleared. Therefore,
force_dma_unencrypted(dev) must be true to use such a pool.

The current code already does this and uses the swiotlb pool correctly
on SME. The challenge arises when we want to force SWIOTLB
bouncing even for devices that can handle encrypted DMA addresses (more
on that below). For such a config force_dma_uencrypted(dev) will return
false and swiotlb will be marked cc_shared/decrypted = true; This trip
the new check we added.

	/* swiotlb pool is incorrect for this device */
	if (unlikely(mem->cc_shared != force_dma_unencrypted(dev)))
		return (phys_addr_t)DMA_MAPPING_ERROR;

We can also do

	if (cc_platform_has(CC_ATTR_GUEST_MEM_ENCRYPT)) {
		/* swiotlb pool is incorrect for this device */
		if (unlikely(mem->cc_shared != force_dma_unencrypted(dev)))
			return (phys_addr_t)DMA_MAPPING_ERROR;

		/* Force attrs to match the kind of memory in the pool */
		if (mem->cc_shared)
			*attrs |= DMA_ATTR_CC_SHARED;
		else
			*attrs &= ~DMA_ATTR_CC_SHARED;
	} else {
		/*
		 * Host memory encryption where device requires an
		 * unencrypted dma_addr_t due to dma mask limit
    		 */
		if (force_dma_unencrypted(dev))
			*attrs |= DMA_ATTR_CC_SHARED;
		else
			*attrs &= ~DMA_ATTR_CC_SHARED;
	}


Here I see value in having DMA_ATTR_UNENCRYPTED. The question is do we
need to split this into two flags and introduce the resulting code
duplication.

If we are not able to reach the memory because of the memory encryption
bit, then isn't dev_cannot_reach_memory(dev) the same as
force_dma_unencrypted(dev)? If so, that is how it is already done.

I am wondering whether we can keep this simpler by ignoring the
swiotlb=force kernel parameter and keeping cc_shared as it is, even
though that can be confusing when looking at SME.

The three configurations we need to consider here are:

1) SEV-SNP guest
2) SME host with iommu=translated
3) SME host with iommu=passthrough

IIUC, all of the above work with the current code because we mark the
swiotlb as cc_shared/decrypted when CC_ATTR_MEM_ENCRYPT is set (i.e.,
this applies to an SME host as well).

The challenge arises when the user forces swiotlb bouncing with the
swiotlb=force command-line option. At that point, all devices, including
those whose DMA mask can handle encrypted DMA addresses, are forced to
use SWIOTLB. That becomes a problem because SWIOTLB is marked as
decrypted by default.

How about something like the following?

x86/dma: Disable forced SWIOTLB bouncing for SME IOMMU passthrough

With host memory encryption and IOMMU passthrough, DMA address handling
depends on whether a device can address the C-bit. Devices that cannot
address it need DMA addresses with the C-bit cleared, while devices that
can address encrypted memory should keep using encrypted DMA addresses.

The default swiotlb pool is marked shared when memory encryption is active.
Forcing all devices through that pool would also force devices capable of
encrypted DMA to use shared mappings. Clear the global swiotlb-force-bounce
state in this mode, and warn when this overrides an explicit swiotlb=force
command-line request.
