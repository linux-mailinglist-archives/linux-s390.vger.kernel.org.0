kobject_put() frees the kobject data.

No, because we check whether we have this kobject already present
in sysfs before we try to initialize it (we have in_sysfs per path
object for this).

paths_info is a kset created during the device initialization. Do you mean,
in case the kset creation fails, this check here should only warn once?
I'm not sure about that, hm.

I did not, sorry.

The release function is supposed to free memory of the structure where
the kobject lies in (our release function is explained below).
The rest is taking care of by the kobject library.

Because we likely don't have all information required to create the kobject
for other paths, e.g. the cssid and chpid (which are required for the
proper name).

I can't think of a user just yet. I'll keep this in mind for further
improvements. I certainly won't hurt to create uevents here.

As you correctly pointed out, our release function doesn't do anything.
This is because our path data is a (static) part of our device.
This data is critical to keep our devices operational.
We can't simply rely on allocated memory if systems are under stress. 

Having this data dynamically allocated involves a lot of rework of our
path handling as well. There are a few things that are subject to improvement
and evaluating whether our dasd_path structures can be dynamic is one of
these things. However, even then, the above concern persists and I
highly doubt that dynamic dasd_paths objects are doable for us at this
moment.

I do understand the concerns, however, we release the memory for dasd_path
structures eventually when dasd_free_device() is called. Until that point,
the data has to be kept alive. The rest is taking care of by the kobject
library.
In our path handling we also make sure that we can always verify/validate
paths information even if a system is under high memory pressure. Another
reason why it would contradictory for dasd_path objects to be dynamic.

I hope this explains the reasoning behind the release function.

so long,
Jan
