There is one build failure with MEMORY_HOTPLUG=y and MEMORY_HOTREMOVE=n.
There are warnings on arm64 and s390 platforms when built with W=1 due
to lack of prototypes required with -Wmissing-prototypes. I have fixed
all these problems for the next iteration when there is broad agreement
on the overall approach.
