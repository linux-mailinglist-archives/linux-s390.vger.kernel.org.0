Actually the scenario is that devA/C/D are assigned, devB is implicitly
owned, and it's devE that blocks the reset.  If you've followed any of
the community forums for vfio over the years, it should be readily
apparent that placing the burden solely on the end user to perform such
a diagnosis is an unreasonable expectation.

Is this a reasonable scenario?  I expect the QEMU support to favor cdev
access where available and fd passing methods will only use cdev, so
QEMU should never mess up to create such an environment.  There should
never be a case where a device is exclusively available via group
rather than cdev.

Yes, let's not create new models for the compatibility interface, stick
with group-opened = group-id = proof-of-ownership.  Thanks,
