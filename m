Of course, the term "vector" should be replaced by something like
"irqnr" or "virq", but I didn't have name changes within scope - just
wanted to fix the printing of that number, as i've stupled over it while
working on something different and wondered why the number differed from
what I had expected, until I seen that it prints hex instead of decimal.

But if you prefer a more complete cleanup, I'll be happy to do it.

I wouldn't say the irq-nr isn't interesting. In my particular case it
was quite what I've been looking for. But you're right, hwirq should
also be printed.

In my case it came in from generic_handle_irq(), and in this case this
irq number (IMHO) has been valid, but nobody handled it, so it went to
ack_bad_irq.

Of course, if this function is meant as a fallback to ack some not
otherwise handled IRQ on the hw, the linux irq number indeed isn't quite
helpful (unless we expect that code to do a lookup to the hw irq).

... rethinking this further ... shouldn't we also pass in even more data
(eg. irq_desc, irqchip, ...), so this function can check which hw to
actually talk to ?

is 'int' correct here ?

BTW: I also wonder why the virq is unsigned int, while hwirq (eg. in
struct irq_data) is unsigned long. shouldn't the virtual number space
be at least as big (or even bigger) than the hw one ?

Okay, makes sense.

OTOH: since both callers (dummychip.c, handle.c) already dump out before
ack_bad_irq(), do we need to print out anything at all ?

I've also seen that many archs increase a counter (some use long, others
atomic_t) - should we also consolidate this in an arch-independent way
in handle.c (or does kstat_incr_irqs_this_cpu already do this) ?
