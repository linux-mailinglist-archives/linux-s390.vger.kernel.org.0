Yeah, I agree.

One thing I already noticed is that I think next_fn() may need to be
changed. If pci_ari_enabled(bus) is true, then it immediately returns 0
on dev =3D=3D NULL while if it is false there is an extra check for non-
contiguous multifunction devices. Even then I think on jailhouse() dev-
>multifunction might not be set at that point. This is in contrast to
s390 where we set dev->multifunction based on information provided by
the platform before scanning the bus. So I'll have to be careful not to
create a state where this works on s390 but might not work for
jailhouse.

I also do wonder what the role of the PCI_SCAN_ALL_PCIE_DEVS flag
should be here. At least the comment in only_one_child() sounds a lot
like that flag kind of indicates the same thing.

I'll do some more investigation and testing and report back. I do agree
that there seems to be some potential for cleanup here.
