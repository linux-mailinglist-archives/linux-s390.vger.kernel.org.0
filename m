Re-reading Suren's commit log for fb49c455323ff8
("fork: lock VMAs of the parent process when forking"),
it seems that vm_start_write() is used to protect
against a race where anon_vma changes from NULL to
non-NULL during fork. In that scenario, we hold the
mmap_lock write lock, but not vma_start_write(), so a
concurrent anon_vma_prepare() could still install an
anon_vma.

"    A concurrent page fault on a page newly marked read-only by the page
    copy might trigger wp_page_copy() and a anon_vma_prepare(vma) on the
    source vma, defeating the anon_vma_clone() that wasn't done because the
    parent vma originally didn't have an anon_vma, but we now might end up
    copying a pte entry for a page that has one.
"

If that is the case, then your change does not work.

Nowadays, nobody calls anon_vma_prepare(vma) directly.
Instead, vmf_anon_prepare() is used, and we always
require the mmap_lock read lock before calling
__anon_vma_prepare(). As a result, anon_vma cannot
transition from NULL to non-NULL during fork.

So the original race condition has effectively
disappeared.

You also mentioned the madvise() case. If I understand
correctly, madvise() should take mmap_lock before
modifying anon_vma. Only some parts of madvise() can
support per-VMA locking. Therefore, we probably do not
need:

if (vma->anon_vma) {
vma_start_write_killable(src_vma);
...
}

> Anyway, just a crazy idea, I may miss some corner cases.

To me, it seems that we could remove vma_start_write()
entirely now. Or is that an even crazier idea?

Thanks
