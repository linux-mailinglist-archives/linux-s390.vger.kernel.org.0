Thanks for working on this!  Some preliminary comments (it will take a
few days for me to find time to fully review this):

This should be based on libcrypto-next.  And as with any kernel patch,
it should include a base-commit so that people know where it applies to.

This should be split into three patches: (1) the arch/s390/ changes, (2)
adding the library functions themselves, and (3) adding the tests.

We'll also need to integrate the existing arch-optimized SHA-3 code, and
reimplement the SHA-3 crypto_shash algorithms on top of the library.
Let me know whether you're planning to do that to.  If not, I can do it.

In kerneldoc comments, please make it clear that lengths are measured in
bytes, and that the functions can be called in any context.

The testing situation looks odd.  This patch adds six KUnit test suites:
one for each of the SHA-3 algorithms.  But they only include the
hash-test-template.h test cases, and they don't test the unique behavior
of SHAKE.  The KUnit tests need to fully test the library.

I see you also have a test in sha3_mod_init(), which doesn't make sense.
The tests should be in the KUnit test suite(s).  If you intended for the
sha3_mod_init() test to be a FIPS pre-operational self-test, then (1) it
would first need to be confirmed with the people doing FIPS
certifications that a FIPS pre-operational self-test is actually
necessary here, (2) it would need to be fixed to actually fulfill the
requirements for that type of test such as panicing the kernel on
failure, and (3) it would need to come in its own patch with its own
explanation.  But, unless you are sure you actually need the FIPS test,
just omit it out for now and focus on the real tests.

I also think that splitting the SHA-3 tests into six KUnit test suites
is awkward.  I know I did something similar for SHA-2, but it made more
sense for SHA-2 because (1) there are only four SHA-2 variants, (2)
SHA-256 and SHA-512 don't share any code, and (3) there wasn't anything
more to add on top of hash-test-template.h.  In contrast, SHA-3 has six
variants, which all share most of their code, and there will need to be
SHA-3 specific tests (for the XOFs).

I think what I'd recommend is creating a single sha3_kunit test suite.
Make it instantiate hash-test-template.h once to test one of the
algorithms, maybe SHA3-256.  Then add test cases (that is, additional
KUnit test cases in the same KUnit test suite) that cover the code
specific to the other variants, including the XOFs.
