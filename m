I'm not sure yet.  Let's back up a little:  I'm missing an
architectural description how you're intending to do error
recovery in the VM.  If I understand correctly, you're
informing the VM of the error via the ->error_detected() callback.

You're saying you need to check for accessibility of the device
prior to resetting it from the VM, does that mean you're attempting
a reset from the ->error_detected() callback?

According to Documentation/PCI/pci-error-recovery.rst, the device
isn't supposed to be considered accessible in ->error_detected().
The first callback which allows access is ->mmio_enabled().

I also don't quite understand why the VM needs to perform a reset.
Why can't you just let the VM tell the host that a reset is needed
(PCI_ERS_RESULT_NEED_RESET) and then the host resets the device on
behalf of the VM?

Furthermore, I'm thinking that you should be using pci_channel_offline()
to detect accessibility of the device, rather than reading from
Config Space and checking for PCI_POSSIBLE_ERROR().

Yes, right now we can't assume that drivers call pci_save_state()
in their probe hook if they modified Config Space.  They may rely
on the state being saved prior to reset or a D3hot/D3cold transition.
So we need to keep the pci_dev_save_and_disable() call for now.

Generally the expectation is that Config Space is accessible when
performing a reset with pci_try_reset_function().  Since that's
apparently not guaranteed for your use case, I'm wondering if you
might be using the function in a context it's not supposed to be used.

Thanks,

Lukas
