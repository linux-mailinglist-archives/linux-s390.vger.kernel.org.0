;-) yeah, maybe us working closely across kernel and systemd will help
improve relations.

In principle the same happens on existing and new systemd i.e. we get
new eno<UID_in_decimal>â€¦ interface names. Due to the way naming
priorities work this will become the dominant interface name but thanks
to altname support in current kernels we expect all old settings,
routing rules etc. to remain working with the old name.

This only happens however if the Linux instance is running with active
UID Uniqueness Checking, this is a Hypervisor/Platform setting that
enforces that no PCI device can be attached if one with the same UID is
already attached. So far this setting was hidden inside the kernel but
I recently committed a change to expose it to userspace here:
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/s390/linux.git/commit/?h=features&id=408f2c9c15682fc21b645fdec1f726492e235c4b

That said, we're also still open for other approaches for example as
floated by Lennart in this comment:
https://github.com/systemd/systemd/pull/18829#discussion_r584794766
But this of course also depends on whether the kernel community is open
to reusing the index attribute or has other preferences.
