This is you bending definition of what process_mrelease is. And I
disagree. There is nothing about aggressiveness for process_mrelease.
There are no aging assumptions. We do not have an official man page but
this is from the initial comment introducing the syscall
        DESCRIPTION
          The process_mrelease() system call is used to free the memory of
          an exiting process.

          The pidfd selects the process referred to by the PID file
          descriptor.
          (See pidfd_open(2) for further information)

          The flags argument is reserved for future use; currently, this
          argument must be specified as 0.

Userspace oom killers are one obvious users of the interface.

But any user of this interface will see side effects of your
implementation.

Look, you haven't convinced me that you are fully aware of all the
consequences. Your arguments are weak and you seem to be uninterested
about usecases beyond your specific Android LMK implementation.

So I am not in support of this change, same as with the page cache one.
Again, I am NOT NAKing this patch but I do insist a) the patch
description is damn clear about side effects and b) there is a support
from other non-Android people using this syscall.
