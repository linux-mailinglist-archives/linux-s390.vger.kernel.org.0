IIUC, then the OOM kill if invoked from the kernel just takes down
without permission checking what it wants to take down. That makes a lot
of sense and is mostly safe - after all it is the kernel that initiates
the kill.

However, when userspace initiates the kill we need at least the
semantics you proposed, Michal. You can only kill processes that you
have the necessary privileges over otherwise you end up allowing to
SIGKILL setuid binaries over which you hold no privileged possibly
generating information leaks or worse.

The other thing to keep in mind is that currently pidfds explicitly do
not to allow to signal taks that are outside of their pid namespace
hierarchy - see pidfd_send_signal()'s permission checking. I don't want
to break these semantics - it's just very bad api design if signaling
suddenly behaves differently and pidfd suddenly convey the ability to
do a very wide signal scope.

The other thing is that pidfds are handles that can be sent around using
SCM_RIGHTS which means they could be forwarded to a container or another
privileged user that then initiates kill semantics.

The other thing is that the type of pidfd selects the scope of the
signaling operation:

* If the pidfd was created via PIDFD_THREAD then the scope of the signal
  is by default the individual thread - unless the signal itself is
  thread-group oriented ofc.

* If the pidfd was created wihout PIDFD_THREAD then the scope of the
  signal is by default the thread-group.

* pidfd_send_signal() provides explicitly scope overrides:

  (1) PIDFD_SIGNAL_THREAD
  (2) PIDFD_SIGNAL_THREAD_GROUP
  (3) PIDFD_SIGNAL_PROCESS_GROUP

  The flags should be mostly self-explanatory.

  So I really dislike the idea of now letting the pidfd passed to
  process_mrelease() to have an implicit scope suddenly. The problem is
  that this is very opaque to userspace and introduces another way to
  signal a group of processes.

IOW, I still dislike the fact that process_mrelease() is suddenly turned
into a signal sending syscall and I really dislike the fact that it
implies a "kill everything with that mm and cross other thread-groups".

I wonder if you couldn't just add PIDFD_SIGNAL_MM_GROUP or something to
pidfd_send_signal() instead.
