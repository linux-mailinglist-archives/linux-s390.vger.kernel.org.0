I meant "Initial Chaining Value". On s390, this memory is set to zero by the
KIMD/KLMD instructions so that it can be skipped in the init() calls.

Let me figure out, if me and my colleagues can do the testing for you.
Unfortunately, I'll be unavailable for the next two weeks. But I'll come back
with a solution for the testing.

Would it make sense to provide a delayed zeroize mechanism of the initial
chaining value (ICV), and architectures may implement it or not? The feature
on s390 is exactly that: a delayed zeroize of the ICV, done by the instruction.

Ok, sounds reasonable.

Ok, I'll come back to you on that.
