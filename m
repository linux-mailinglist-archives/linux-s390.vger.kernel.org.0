RCU callbacks are not ordered so that doesn't seem like it helps..

synchronize_rcu would do the job since it is ordered, but I think the
performance cost is too great to just call it from mmdrop

rcu_barrier() followed by call_rcu on the mm struct might work, but I
don't know the cost

A per-cpu refcount scheme might also do the job reasonably

Making the page frag pool global (per-cpu global I guess) would also
remove the need to reach back to the freeable mm_struct and reduce the
need for struct page memory. This views it as a special kind of
kmemcache.

Another approach is to not use a rcu_head in the ptdesc at all.

With a global kmemcache-like-thing we could probably also organize
something where you don't use a rcu_head in the ptdesc, but instead
just a naked 'next' pointer. This would give enough space to have two
next pointers and the next pointers can be re-used for the normal free
list as well.

In this flow you'd thread the free'd frags onto a waterfall of global
per-cpu lists:
 - RCU free the next cycle
 - RCU free this cycle
 - Actually free

Where a single rcu_head and single call_rcu frees the entire 2nd list
to the 3rd list and then schedules the 1st list to be RCU'd next. This
eliminates the need to store a function pointer in the ptdesc at
all.

It requires some global per-cpu lock on the free/alloc paths however,
but this is basically what every other arch does as it frees the page
back to the page allocator.

I suspect that two next pointers would also eliminate pt_frag_refcount
entirely as we can encode that information in the low bits of the next
pointers.

We do that have really weird "type safe by rcu" thing in the
allocators, but I don't quite know how it works.

Yeah, it would be good to understand if this is really sufficiently
beneficial..

Can arches opt in to RCU freeing page table support and still keep
your series sane?

Honestly, I feel like trying to RCU enable page tables should be its
own series. It is a sufficiently tricky subject on its own right.
