Heiko contacted me as you apparently requested that someone from s390
takes part in this discussion. I now spend over a day trying to make
any sens from this discussion but failed. The way I see it is.

On one hand there is KEXEC_SIG which is specifically designed to verify
the signatures of kernel images in kexec_file_load. From the beginning
it was designed in a way that every architecture (in fact even every
image type) can define its own callback function as needed. It's design
is simple and easy to extend and thus was adopted by all architectures,
except ppc, so far.

On the other hand there is IMA which is much more general and also
includes the same functionality like KEXEC_SIG but only on some
architectures in some special cases and without proper documentation.

Now Michal wants to adapt KEXEC_SIG for ppc too so distros can rely on all
architectures using the same mechanism and thus reduce maintenance cost.
On the way there he even makes some absolutely reasonable improvements
for everybody.

Why is that so controversial? What is the real problem that should be
discussed here?

Thanks
Philipp
