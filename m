True, the rest is freed when the device is being destroyed with
dasd_free_device().

We set it to true again (See dasd_path_create_kobj()). (More details below)

I think this could be changed to one warning.

You could use kobject_del(), but it is rather intended to be used for
a two-stage removal of the kobject.

We don't re-register kobjects over and over again. The kobjects are
infact initialized and created only _once_. This is done either during
device initialization (after dasd_eckd_read_conf() in
dasd_eckd_check_characteristics()) or when a path is newly added
(in the path event handler).
The kobject will stay until the memory for the whole device is being
freed. This is also the reason why the kobject can stay initialized and
we track ourselves whether we did the initialization/creation already
(which we check e.g. when a path is removed and added again).
So, instead of the release function freeing the kobject data,
it is done by our dasd_free_device() (same thing, different function IMHO).

I think the concerns would be more worrisome if we'd remove/add
the kobjects every time. And then I agree, we'd run into trouble.
