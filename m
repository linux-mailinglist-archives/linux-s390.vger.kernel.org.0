Hi Dave, I worked with Claudio and Christian on the initial design
of our approach, so let me chime in here as well.

You're right that there is no mechanism to prevent new references,
but that's really never been the goal either.  We're simply trying
to ensure that no I/O is ever done on a page that is in the "secure"
(or inaccessible) state.  To do so, we rely on the assumption that
all code that starts I/O on a page cache page will *first*:
- mark the page as pending I/O by either taking an extra page
  count, or by setting the Writeback flag; then:
- call arch_make_page_accessible(); then:
- start I/O; and only after I/O has finished:
- remove the "pending I/O" marker (Writeback and/or extra ref)

We thought we had identified all places where we needed to place
arch_make_page_accessible so that the above assumption is satisfied.
You've found at least two instances where this wasn't true (thanks!);
but I still think that this can be fixed by just adding those calls.

Now, if the above assumption holds, then I believe we're safe:
- before we make any page secure, we verify that it is not
  "pending I/O" as defined above (neither Writeback flag, nor
  and extra page count)
- *during* the process of making the page secure, we're protected
  against any potential races due to changes in that status, since
  we hold the page lock (and therefore the Writeback flag cannot
  change), and we've frozen page references (so those cannot change).

This implies that before I/O has started, the page was made
accessible; and as long as the page is marked "pending I/O"
it will not be made inaccessible again.

I don't really see how that could happen; my understanding is that
page_freeze_refs simply causes potential users to spin and wait
until it is no longer frozen.  For example, find_get_page will
in the end call down to find_get_entry, which does:

        if (!page_cache_get_speculative(page))
                goto repeat;

Am I misunderstanding anything here?

As I said above, that wasn't really the goal for our approach.

In particular, note that we *must* have secure pages present in the
page table of the secure guest (that is a requirement of the architecture;
note that the "secure" status doesn't just apply to the phyiscal page,
but a triple of "*this* host physical page is the secure backing store
of *this* guest physical page in *this* secure guest", which the HW/FW
tracks based on the specific page table entry).

As a consequence, the page really also has to remain present in the
page cache (I don't think Linux mm code would be able to handle the
case where a file-backed page is in the page table but not page cache).

I'm not sure what exactly the requirements for your use case are; if those
are significantly differently, maybe we can work together to find an
approach that works for both?

Bye,
Ulrich
