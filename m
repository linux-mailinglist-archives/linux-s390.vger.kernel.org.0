I did some testing and created a prototype that gets rid of
arch/s390/pci_dma.c and works soley via dma-iommu on top of our IOMMU
driver. It looks like the existing dma-iommu code allows us to do this
with relatively simple changes to the IOMMU driver only, mostly just
implementing iotlb_sync(), iotlb_sync_map() and flush_iotlb_all() so
that's great. They also do seem to map quite well to our RPCIT I/O TLB
flush so that's great. For now the prototype still uses 4k pages only.

With that the performance on the LPAR machine hypervisor (no paging) is
on par with our existing code. On paging hypervisors (z/VM and KVM)
i.e. with the hypervisor shadowing the I/O translation tables, it's
still slower than our existing code and interestingly strict mode seems
to be better than lazy here. One thing I haven't done yet is implement
the map_pages() operation or adding larger page sizes. Maybe you have
some tips what you'd expect to be most beneficial? Either way we're
optimistic this can be solved and this conversion will be a high
ranking item on my backlog going forward.

I also stumbled over the following patch series which I think would
also help our paging hypervisor cases a lot since it should alleviate
the cost of shadowing short lived mappings:

https://lore.kernel.org/linux-iommu/20210806103423.3341285-1-stevensd@google.com/

Sadly it seems it hasn't gained much traction so far.

Thanks,
Niklas
