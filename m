Err no, it serialises against literally any modification or read of any
characteristic of VMAs.

Except if we don't take it and vma->anon_vma is NULL, then somebody can
anon_vma_prepare() and change vma->anon_vma midway through a fork and completely
screw up the anon_vma fork hierarchy.

So no.

vma->anon_vma can be changed.

Firstly, with no VMA write lock, !vma->anon_vma means a fault can race and
secondly copy_page_range() checks vma_needs_copy(), there are other cases - PFN
maps, mixed maps, UFFD W/P (ugh), guard regions.

So yeah this isn't sufficient.

Yeah that's totally broken fo reasons above as I said :)

It will totally break how the anon_vma hierarchy works :) See the links at the
top of https://ljs.io/talks for a link to various slides on anon_vma behaviour
(it's really a pain to think about because it's a super broken abstraction).

You could end up with a CoW mapping that's unreachable from rmap and you could
get some nasty issues with page table entries pointing at freed folios :)

Yeah sorry to push back here but this is just not a viable approach.

And this is forgetting that we have relied on page faults being blocked by fork
_forever_, who knows what else has baked in assumptions about that
serialisation.

Forking is one of the nastiest parts of mm and has had multiple, subtle, corner
case breakages that have been a nightmare to deal with.

So I'm very much against changing this behaviour to try to fix something in the
fault path.

We should address the fault path issues in the fault path :)
