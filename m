I see, good point. I think I can add this to my patch, and a different
subject like "dma-debug: fix sg checks in debug_dma_map_sg()".

However, I do not quite understand why check_for_stack() does not also
consider s->length. It seems to check only the first page of an sg
element.

So, shouldn't check_for_stack() behave similar to check_for_illegal_area(),
i.e. check all source sg elements for overlap with the task stack area?

If yes, then this probably should be a separate patch, but I can try
to come up with something and send a new RFC with two patches. Maybe
check_for_stack() can also be integrated into check_for_illegal_area(),
they are both called at the same places. And mapping memory from the
stack also sounds rather illegal.
