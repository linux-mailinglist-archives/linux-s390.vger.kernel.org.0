Yes, this all seems to work as designed, and it is slowly beginning to
make some sense. The only other way to stop it would be to return from
op->show, w/o printing anything, like it would be done for t->count > 0,
when idx becomes >= t->count. In theory at least, see below.

Thanks. While testing this properly, yet another bug showed up. The idx
in op->show remains 0 in all iterations, so I always see the same line
printed t->count times (or infinitely, ATM). Not sure if this only shows
on s390 due to endianness, but the reason is this:

  unsigned int idx = *(unsigned int *)v;

IIUC, void *v is always the same as loff_t *ppos, and therefore idx also
should be *ppos. De-referencing the loff_t * with an unsigned int * only
gives the upper 32 bit half of the 64 bit value, which remains 0.

This would be fixed e.g. with

  unsigned int idx = (unsigned int) *(loff_t *) v;

With this fixed, my original patch actually also works for t->count > 0,
because then op->show would return w/o printing anything when idx reaches
t->count. For t->count > 0, it would even work w/o any extra checks in
op->start because of that, only "No data" would be printed infinitely.

It probably still makes sense to make this explicit in op->start, by
checking separately for !*ppos && !t->count, and returning NULL for
*ppos >= t->count, as you suggested.

I think I will also make idx an unsigned long again, like it was before
commit 64dd68497be7, and similar to t->count. Not sure if it needs to
be, and with proper casting unsigned int is also possible, but why
change it?
