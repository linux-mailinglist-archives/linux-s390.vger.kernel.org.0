international contractors, building and handling of government

I am in the position to transfer the sum of US$17M of which I have
written a memo informing the Government that this fund belongs to a
Contractor waiting to be paid his contract sum; I want to transfer and
invest this fund into your company as an investment fund from South
Africa to your country.

The fund will be shared on the ratio of 60-40%; 40% for you on the
assistance rendered. Please note that this fund will not be
investigated or recalled in the near feature as all document to move
this fund to your account will be legally obtained. You are to send me

want the fund to be transferred to.

As soon as you agree to my proposition, I will send you my number to
reach me. I want you to keep this private to yourself. Be assured that
this is a legitimate fund and will be transferred legitimately.

Thanks for your anticipated cooperation.

Yours
