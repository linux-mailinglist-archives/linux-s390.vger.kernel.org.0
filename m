Agreed.

Not in the MM world -- IIRC. I think there is the agreement, that we 
decide what should go into stable and what not.

Andrew can correct me if my memory is wrong.

But we can always jump in and say that something should not go to stable 
trees.

I think we should document all that in the cover letter, an describe 
that this partial revert is only possible after [4], and that that must 
be considered when attempting any kind of stable backports.

Thanks for pointing all that out.
