Eric your idea was whirling around in my head for at least 3 month now.
It would be great to have a way to offer an shash() implementation which
clearly states that it is not for use in atomic context. E.g. like as 
you
wrote with a new flag. I'll work out something in this direction and 
push
it onto the crypto mailing list :-)
