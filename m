Hm, what about transitional devices?

It can turn off VERSION_1, but not legacy. (I had hacked up a patchset
to potentially disable legacy some time ago, but did not have any
resources to follow up on this.)

From my perspective the problem is that the version of the device
remains in limbo as long as the features have not yet been finalized,
which means that the endianness of the config space remains in limbo as
well. Both device and driver might come to different conclusions.
