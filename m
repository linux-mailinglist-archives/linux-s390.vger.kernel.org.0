But in practice it's the opposite.  Making it an ahash forces users who would
otherwise just be using shash to use ahash instead.

No one is asking for it to be available to IPsec.  And this is just a MAC, not a
cipher.  But more generally, sleepable algorithms could still be used via an
adapter using cryptd, or by making IPsec support using a workqueue like all the
storage encryption/integrity systems already do.  In any case this would be a
rare (or nonexistent?) use case and should be treated as such.

That won't solve all the problems with ahash, for example the per-request
allocation.  We'll still end up with something that is worse for 99% of users,
while also doing a very poor job supporting the 1% (even assuming it's 1% and
not 0% which it very well might be) who actually think they want off-CPU
hardware crypto acceleration.  Not to mention the nonsense like having
"synchronous asynchronous hashes".

I think it's time to admit that the approach you're trying to take with the
crypto API is wrong.  This has been known for years.

The primary API needs to be designed around and optimized for software crypto,
which is what nearly everyone wants.
