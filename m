I think the crucial detail is that we can fail gup(), while we cannot
ever fail kmap() or whatever else a device needs to do.

I suspect this happens because FOLL_TOUCH or something later does
set_page_dirty() on the page, which then eventually gets it in
writeback.

Failing gup() ealier, should ensure the above VM_BUG never happens,
unless someone is doing dodgy things.

But for SEV we would actually need to fail this
arch_make_page_acesssible() thing, right? The encrypted guest pages
cannot be sanely accessed by the host IIRC, ever. Isn't their encryption
key linked to the phys addr of the page?

I'm confused, why does it matter who accesses it? The point is that they
want to access it through this vaddr/mapping.
