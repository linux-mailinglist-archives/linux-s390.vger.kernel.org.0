Maybe the problem here is stating that having the same UUID is a
requirement in the patch series description. I agree this is
not a kernel requirement; however, a live guest migration will not
succeed unless the destination host has a mediated device with
a UUID that matches that of the UUID of the mediated device used
to pass through s390 crypto devices to the source guest for the
reason I stated above. Would it help if I removed item #1 as a
requirement?

Got it.

As I stated in the cover letter description, all access to the AP 
devices is handled by the s390 Interpretive Execution facility, so 
without a complete redesign of the vfio_ap device driver, there is no 
way to know that a master key change is being requested. I do get your 
point, however, so I will figure out how best to handle this in 
userspace. Thanks for you review.
