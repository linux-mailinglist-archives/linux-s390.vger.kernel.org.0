Why?  There's nothing arch-specific here, right?  Either the file is
present or not.

Why not just a simple file, no need for arch-specific names if this
really can show up under other arches?

So can't userspace figure this out on its own?

Please explain it more, but why would userspace care about this?  If
userspace sees a UID "collision" then it just adds something else to the
end of the name to make it unique.

What is it supposed to do differently based on the value/presense of
this file?

So what can userspace do with this?  What tool is going to rely on this?
