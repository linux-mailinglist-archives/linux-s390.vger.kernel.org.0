I think I already answered this here with mention of the hwrng driver:
https://lore.kernel.org/all/YsSAn2qXqlFkS5sH@zx2c4.com/

Anyway, I would recommend keeping it available in all contexts, so that
s390 isn't a special case to keep in mind, and because Harald said he
couldn't measure an actual problem existing for real. Plus, it's not as
though we're talking about RT kernels or a problem that would affect RT.
But if you're convinced that even the extremely rare case poses a issue,
doing the !in_hardirq() thing won't be the end of the world either and
is partly mitigated by the hwrng driver mentioned earlier. So I think
it's mostly up to you guys on what the tradeoffs are and what's
realistic and such.

Jason
