What is const128[] here?

It's not immediately obvious to me how user space would do this, but I'll take
it on faith that it may be possible.

There has been pushback on introducing new primitives [1] but I don't think
that's a reason not to considder it.

Thanks for the analysis! I look forward to seeing your conclusion... although
I'm not sure I'll be qualified to evaluate it mathematically.

FWIW, I previously had a go at various schemes using siphash to calculate some
random bits. I found it to be significantly slower than this prng. I've so far
taken the view that 6 bits of randomness is not much of a defence against brute
force so we really shouldn't be spending too many cycles to generate the bits.
If we can get to approach to work, I think that's best.

Thanks,
Ryan
