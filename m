I looked into that, but given that the block device is allocated as part
of the inode we'd need to tell ->alloc_inode if we want to allocate the
small inode without the gendisk, or the large one with it which doesn't
work with the current interface.  Beause the hd_struct is gone we're
still not using more structures in the I/O path than we did before.
