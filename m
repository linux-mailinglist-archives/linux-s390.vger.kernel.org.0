This could clearly cause trouble if the pud/p4d/pgd constructors start
to diverge. In principle this could be addressed when upgrading by
calling the dtor on the old pgd and then the ctor on the new pud/p4d.
That said since there is now only one dtor, and the ctor are all the
same, it's probably good enough.

I'll mention in passing that my own series (that introduced PGD-level
ctor/dtor) really aimed at supporting the kpkeys page table protection
RFC [1], where hooks are inserted into the ctor/dtor to modify the pkey
page tables are mapped with. No idea if that would work with this sort
of upgrade path, but since s390 does not support pkeys this is just a
theoretical issue :)
