I am assuming here that you meant to say that after applying
patch 1/2, there is a possibility for a use after free error.

I am fine with squashing these if that is the consensus here. Prior
to this patch, the remove callback function returned -EBUSY
if a guest is still using the matrix_mdev (i.e., matrix_mdev->kvm
not NULL), so the matrix_mdev was not freed and hence the
memory leak for this this patch was designed to fix.
