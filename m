Good point, will change this to /sys/bus/pci/unique_uids

I guess other arches would be free to implement the same UID concept
as above I'm happy to change this to a simple file.

Userspace can figure out that they do not currently collide but
without this attribute it doesn't know that the platform also guarantees
that no collision will be introduced by e.g. hotplug. We are however
pushing to have this always turned on so yes over time this attribute
will hopefully be always 1 but this will take years.

The idea is that userspace can be sure that no collisions will ever
happen. Consequently we can tell users that if they have UID uniqueness
checking on in their partition definition and they add a PCIe NIC with UID
X the network device will be named "enoX". This is particularly important
since during installation users might have to specify the interface name
as part of the installer's boot parameters _before_ Linux even boots.
Note that in our usual environments a lot of customers do not use things
like DHCP and might have very strict rules which interfaces will be
used for what. Similarly this would allow users to know exact interface
names when specifying e.g a Cloud Init configuration.

When UIDs are not guaranteed to be unique they are often unset that
is 0 and then the most stable identifier for a PCI function that a user
can know before even booting Linux is /sys/bus/pci/function_id.
This Function ID (FID) is also used as the hotplug slot
number and thus the X in "ensX.." interface names.
Thus, this would instead be the preferred interface naming scheme that
still allows the user to relate the interface names inside Linux
to what they can see in their machine/hypervisor configuration.

It should be noted that in our environments often the Linux admin(s)
will be a different group with very different background then the machine/mainframe
admin and the FID and UID are ofent the only per device information both
sides can see to identify an interface. Currently not even
the MAC address can be seen from the machine configuration or
even when listing devices in the z/VM hypervisor so we really want to use
either the FID or the UID in interface names.

In the future similar considerations may apply to other PCI devices.

We have a systemd/udev patch waiting on this RFC discussion
that will use this attribute for the aforementioned decision of either
preferring the existing "ens<hotplug_slot_numnber>…" or "eno<UID>…"
interface names based on this value.

As I mentioned in the cover letter we are also
considering instead going for /sys/firmware/.. but as far as
I can see that currently really needs much uglier raw kobject handling and
would lose the direct relation to PCI and creates the question
why PCI code puts stuff in /sys/firmware/… or alternatively which
other code deals with a PCI specific value.
