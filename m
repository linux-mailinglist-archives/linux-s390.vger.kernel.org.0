Hi Bjorn,

I've thought about this more and even implemented a proof of concept
patch for a global attribute using a pcibios_has_reproducible_addressing()
hook. 

However after implementing it I think as a more general and
future proof concept it makes more sense to do this as a per device
attribute, maybe as another flag in "stuct pci_dev" named something
like "reliable_address". My reasoning behind this can be best be seen
with a QEMU example. While I expect that QEMU can easily guarantee
that one can always use "0000:01:00.0" for a virtio-pci NIC and
thus enp1s0 interface name, the same might be harder to guarantee
for a SR-IOV VF passed through with vfio-pci in that same VM and
even less so if a thunderbolt controller is passed through and
enumeration may depend on daisy chaining. The QEMU example
also applies to s390 and maybe others will in the future.
I'll send an RFC for a per device attribute but didn't want to
let this discussion stand as if we had abandoned the idea and if
you would prefer a global attribute I can also send an RFC for that.

Besst regards,
Niklas
