See, and I am not convinced that this is the case, because you really 
only report one example (Monkey) and I have to assume it is a special 
case then.

And you don't mention what the baseline configuration was. For example, 
how was compaction configured?

Just to clarify, what is monkey?

Monkey HTTP server? MonkeyTest disk benchmark? UI/Application Exerciser 
Monkey?

IIRC, there are plenty. One example is will-it-scale.

Have a look at https://github.com/intel/lkp-tests.git
