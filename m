Thanks for more details on the test.

Okay, but then I assume the target goal of your patch set is to minimize 
CPU consumption/allocation stall time when allocating larger order pages.

Currently you state "the probablity of high-order-pages allocation would 
be increased significantly", but I assume that's then not 100% correct. 
What you measure is the stall time to allocate higher order pages, not 
that you can allocate them.

Okay, again, this is then some optimization for allocation speed; which 
makes it less attractive IMHO (at least for more invasive changes), 
because I suspect this mostly helps in corner cases (Monkey benchmarks 
corner cases AFAIU).

Rather if you have proactive compaction 
(/proc/sys/vm/compaction_proactiveness). But I assume because you're 
messing with older kernels, that you didn't compare against that yet. 
Would be worth a comparison.

Essentially CONFIG_SPARSEMEM, whereby we can have huge holes in physical 
memory layout and memory areas coming/going with memory hot(un)plug. 
Usually we manage all metadata per section. For example, pageblocks are 
allocated per section. We avoid arrays that depend on the 
initial/maximum physical memory size.
