As far as I understand systemd/udev uses the PCI geographical address
by default ("enP<domain>p<bus>s<hotplug_slot_idx>...") for PCI attached
network interfaces in many cases and a lot of users have already built
their firewall/routing rules on these.

At the same time as you said this isn't ideal. On s390 things are a
bit special since it's either really unstable, if UID Checking
is not enforced (the value I wanted to expose is 0) the domain
part and thus the interface name may change between reboots.
On the other hand when it is enforced, the Domain can be defined
in the machine configuration (IOCDS, think Domain XML but formatted
for punch cards) and the bus is always 00.
The PCI geographical address and thus network interface names are then
stable in the same way as with our CCW attached network interfaces where
the CCW addresses have been stable for a long time and are regularly
used for configuration. The interface would however still conform to
the existing systemd/udev standard theme so the only change the user
sees is that we would prefer the interface naming scheme which
does not include the hotplug slot index (ehotplug slot indices are unique
in the machine hypervisor and thus can't be the same in to guests
on the same machine). We would thus not add a new name at all and
thanks to the altname mechanism all existing rules including
persistent naming via manual udev rules would keep working.

Now taking this beyond s390 my idea is that under some circumstances
just as with UID Uniqueness for us, the platform can tell if a PCI
geographical address is a reliable identifier thus sytemd/udev
has more information about the quality of existing naming schemes
incorporating information from the geographical address.

Looking at my personal KVM guests (Ubuntu, Arch Linux, Ubuntu ARM64)
as well as my workstation (Arch Linux) all of them use a scheme
with parts of the geographical address.

So in essence my idea is all about either choosing the best existing
default name or making sure we at least know if it may not be reliable.

I hope that makes sense and I have added Lennart Poettering
as he's the one everyone likes to blame for these names or at
least can probably tell me what I missed.

Best,
Niklas
