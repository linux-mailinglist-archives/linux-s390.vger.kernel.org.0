I asked about the chained waiting :) I'm aware you've observed contention on
write lock, you said so in your LSF talk.

So have you observed that or is this a theory?

Err I'm talking about fork? The patch you reference is a change to fork?

So you're saying that Fb49c455323ff which explicitly takes the VMA write lock on
fork, was somehow an addendum after fork didnt take the mmap write lock?

I must be imagining
https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.0/source/kernel/fork.c#L590 then in v6.0
pre-vma locks :)

I suspect that's _not_ what you're saying, so now what you're suggesting as I
stated above, is to fundamentally change fork behaviour to account for the
existing per-VMA lock behaviour on the fault path?

Again I state - are you really sure you want to fundamentally change fork
behaviour for this?

I am extremely concerned about doing that.

Again, you're saying we should fundamentally change the way fork has worked
forever to work around something else.

At LSF I raised the fact that Josef himself suggested we simply drop this I/O
waiting behaviour for file-backed mapppings. Isn't there a way forward that way
rather than 'hey let's drop locks and hope for the best!'

I am really reticent about this because we've seen HORRIBLE bugs come from fork
behaviour, especially edge cases, and mm testing isn't great so I am basically
opposed to this, and you're not really convincing me here.

Yeah or we could do something different, it isn't a case of you get to do one of
two options you propose - the maintainers decide which way is appropriate.

Of the two options dropping the lock on the fault path rather than this fork
insanity is my preference but I wonder if we can't find another way.

Let me read through the series and give more thoughts I guess.
