Not sure what you mean by this, but I also don't think it matters.
After coding up the fix for this and testing it, I've learned that
if a user attempts to remove an mdev via the sysfs 'remove'
attribute while the mdev fd is still open (i.e., in use by the guest),
the mdev remove callback is not invoked until the fd is closed
(i.e., the guest is shut down). During that time, the mdev is
physically removed from sysfs so no further actions can be taken
on it; but, since the remove callback has yet to be called, the
guest will have access to the AP resources provided by the
mdev during that time. I also tested detaching the mdev device from the 
guest
(i.e., virsh detach-device) while the mdev was in the process of
being removed and this resulted in allowing the remove to
progress due to the mdev fd getting closed when it is detached.

Hot plug/unplug is already supported, so yes, things get cleaned up
properly when the mdev fd is closed. This is handled by the mdev
release callback.
