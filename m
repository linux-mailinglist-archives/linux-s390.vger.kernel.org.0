If reset disables interrupts, why would we need to turn around and
disable interrupts after completion of the reset, unless reset disables
interrupts only for the duration of the reset processing? If interrupts
are disabled only for the duration of the reset, then I question whether
we need to be at all concerned about interrupts in the context of
resetting a queue.

I'm not sure this is a major concern, If the response code is
AP_RESPONSE_RESET_IN_PROGRESS due to a ZAPQ issued by G2 before us,
then once that completes the queue will be reset which accomplishes
the goal anyway. Maybe what should be done in this case is to wait
for the queue to empty?

I'm not sure what IRQ support has to do with how soon the queue is
reset.

Where are you coming up with 1 sec? The only thing my patch did was
remove the disable IRQ. Even if you include the the wait for IRQ disable
to complete, I don't see 1 second of wait time. By my calculations:

5 x 20ms = 100ms  Max wait for ZAPQ response code 0
2 x 20ms =  40ms  Max wait time for qempty
5 x 20ms = 100ms  Max wait for AQIC response code 0
5 x 20ms = 100ms  Max wait time for IRQ clear
----------------
            340ms  Max total wait time

It looks like your concern here is making sure we wait a
sufficient amount of time for the reset to complete. That may be
a question for the firmware folks.

The only thing I can think of is to log an error. I am introducing
logging in the dynamic configuration series if that helps.

I don't know what your concern is here. If the card is not in the
configuration, then no activity can take place until it is reconfigured.

You expressed several concerns above, yet now you say you think we're
safe; I don't understand.

Just a couple of thoughts. The only reason the vfio_ap driver is
concerned with interrupts is because it is intercepting the PQAP(AQIC)
instruction. Shouldn't enabling and disabling interrupts, therefore, be 
solely under the control of the guest? In other words, maybe the vfio_ap
driver should only allocate/deallocate the interrupt controls (i.e., the
NIB and GISA) in response to PQAP(AQIC) interception. When the guest
shuts down, I assume that the PQAP(AQIC) will be executed to disable
interrupts. The driver can do a final cleanup if the NIB and GISA when
the mdev fd is released by the guest if they are still hanging around.
