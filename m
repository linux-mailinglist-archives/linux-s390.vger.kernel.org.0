I created this patch in response to Jason G's review comments I copied
below. He did not mention anything about getting stuck in a 
wait_event_cmd(),
so you may want to ask him about that. To answer your
question, I don't see how we can get stuck in a wait_event_cmd() unless
one of the functions that set the matrix_mdev->kvm_busy flag does not
complete for some reason.

You asked for me to elaborate on the last point in the preceding paragraph;
I did so in my response to your comments/question above.

See above.

That is a matter of opinion. I have no trouble understanding
the "mutex + wait_queue dance", but then again, I wrote the
code, so maybe that is why.

That may be so, but his comments were in support of his
statement that the  mutex + wait_queue did not resolve
the issue reported vai the lockdep splat because it turned
off lockdep.

I think I agree with this statement. Maybe I misunderstood what
Jason meant by "open coding locks like that". Since that comment
directly related to replacing the kvm->busy, I assumed that he
was referring to the "mutex + wait_queue dance" as you called it.
I probably should have probed deeper to discern exactly what
Jason meant by "open coding locks". I took Jason at his word
that "the kvm->busy ... just defeats lockdep analysis" because
I don't have deep knowledge about lockdep.

Even if the kvm->busy does defeat lockdep analysis, I still believe
it fixes the problem for which commit 0cc00c8d4050 was created.
If we don't hold the matrix_dev->lock while the kvm->lock is held
during update of the guest's matrix, lockdep does not report a
problem. That is proven by the tests of this patch.

If commit 0cc00c8d4050 does in fact resolve the issue for which
it was created, then there really is no need for this patch. It
certainly would reduce the amount of change that will be required
to integrate this patch with the "s390/vfio-ap: dynamic configuration
support" patch series currently under review.

The patch removes the matrix_mdev->kvm_busy flag and the
wait_queue. The reason for removing them was because, as
Jason stated, "the kvm->busy ... just defeats lockdep analysis".
