It looks like the case Mirolav pointed out (self-bactrace with NULL
regs) isn't triggered by LKDTM (since it always causes a backtrace from
an exception with non-NULL regs), but we do rely on that elsewhere in
the kernel.

It might be worth adding an LKDTM test to trigger that.

I'll wait for a respin that handles that -- please drop the ack for now.

Thanks,
Mark.
