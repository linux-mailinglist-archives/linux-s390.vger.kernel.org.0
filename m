So the thing that got me started here was:

  https://lkml.kernel.org/r/yt9dimbm79qi.fsf@linux.ibm.com/

And I got a very similar report from Mark for arm64. I'm not sure what
you meanwhile did to get rid of that. But I'm struggling to understand
how s390 can work on v5.10-rc5.

There's just too much calling into tracing while RCU is stopped.
