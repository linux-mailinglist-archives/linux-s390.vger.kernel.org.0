Let me just clarify, so I'm sure I've not misunderstood you. Do you mean opt-out as in
make it default on? IMO that would be a problem, large scale setups would suddenly
start propagating it to upper devices which would cause a lot of unnecessary bcast.
I meant enable it only if needed, and only on specific ports (second part is not
necessary, could be global, I think it's ok either way). I don't think any setup
which has many upper vlans/macvlans would ever enable this.

IIUC it bypasses the bridge and sends a notify peers for the veth peer so it would
generate a grat arp (inetdev_event -> NETDEV_NOTIFY_PEERS).
