My initial version actually contains a few VM_FAULT_PRIVATE_N there, but I
noticed only the minority uses that, especially there's s390 which takes 5
entries.  I didn't had my mind straight on which's the best to go, then I
removed them and posted this simpler version, with comment on each to fix
the issues, more in a sense of raising the problem first.

I agree it isn't a problem at all, not until 32 bits all used up.  But that
seems to slightly encourage more archs from using the new private entries
which I wanted to avoid.

If to take a closer look, we may not really need that much private entries.
With s390, what I read is:

  - VM_FAULT_BADMAP could be replaced directly with VM_FAULT_SIGSEGV?
  - VM_FAULT_PFAULT could be replaced directly with VM_FAULT_BADCONTEXT?

Then if I'm not wrong we can already reduce 5->3 private entries.

I didn't directly change that because I am not 100% confident and I can't
test them myself.  It'll be great if arch people can have a look at either
s390 and arm to see whether there's chance of simplifcations first.  So the
patchset is more of raising the collision issue first, meanwhile great to
attract attention for arch people to refactor upon it.

I can also try to reduce the private entries and introduce PRIVATE entries
accordingly as you suggested, but I'll need more help on reviews and tests
than this one.

Thanks,
