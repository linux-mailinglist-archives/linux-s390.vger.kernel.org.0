	At least from the bonding failover persective, the GARP is
needed when there's a visible topology change (so peers learn the new
path), a change in MAC address, or both.  I don't think it's possible to
determine from bonding which topology changes are visible, so any
failover gets a GARP.  The original intent as best I recall was to cover
IP addresses configured on the bond itself or on VLANs above the bond.

	If I understand the original problem description correctly, the
bonding failover causes the connectivity issue because the network
segments beyond the bond interfaces don't share forwarding information
(i.e., they are completely independent).  The peer (end station or
switch) at the far end of those network segments (where they converge)
is unable to directly see that the "to bond eth0" port went down, and
has no way to know that anything is awry, and thus won't find the new
path until an ARP or forwarding entry for "veth_a2" (from the original
diagram) times out at the peer out in the network.

	I'm a bit concerned this is becoming a interface plumbing
topology change whack-a-mole.

	In the above, what if the veth is plugged into a bridge, and
there's a end station on that bridge?  If it's bridges all the way down,
where does the need for some kind of TCN mechanism stop?

	Or instead of a veth it's an physical network hop (perhaps a
tunnel; something through which notifiers do not propagate) to another
host with another bridge, then what?
