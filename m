You are right that this is ancient, but I think "overlaps with boot
memory and standby memory" were very relevant, that might actually
have been the initial reason for this in ancient times (but I do not
really remember).

With DCSS you can define a fixed start address where the segment will
be loaded into guest address space. The current code queries this address
and directly gives it to vmem_add_mapping(), at least if there is no
overlap with other DCSS segments. If there would be an overlap with
boot memory, and not checked / rejected in vmem_add_mapping(), the
following dcss_diag() would probably fail because AFAIR z/VM will
not allow loading a DCSS with guest memory overlap. So far, so good,
but the vmem_remove_mapping() on the exit path would then remove
(part of) boot memory.

That being said, I think your patch prevents this by moving
request_resource() up, so we should not call vmem_add_mapping()
for such overlaps. I still want to give it some test, but need
to find / setup systems with that ancient technology first :-)

One change introduced by this patch is that we no longer
see -ENOSPC and the corresponding error message from extmem code:
"DCSS %s overlaps with used storage and cannot be loaded"

Instead, now we would see -EBUSY and this message:
"%s needs used memory resources and cannot be loaded or queried"

That should be OK, as it is also the same message that we already
see for overlaps with other DCSSs. But you probably also should
remove that case from the segment_warning() function for
completeness.

Gerald
