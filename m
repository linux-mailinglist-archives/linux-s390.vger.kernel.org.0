Agreed, as we all know, PCI addresses are never a stable name and can
change every boot on some systems.  Never rely on them, but you can use
them as a "hint" for something that you have to determine is different
from something else that is the same type of device.

Only if you can require that they be unique.  Is there such a
requirement and who enforces it?

For USB, it was only "required" to have unique serial numbers for one
class of devices (printers), and even then, it really wasn't enforced
that much so you can't rely on it being unique at all, which makes it
pretty useless :(
