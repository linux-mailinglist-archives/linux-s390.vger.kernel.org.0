The tools are nothing special and again I will be pushing to get the
ones I know about fixed.  One concern is that losing the beginning of
the command line can be quite a bit more painful than losing the end.

That sounds eminently reasonable, thank you very much!

We will be keeping track and setting the value we need, so I would
recommend keeping your current default.  Unless or until reviews or
experience proves otherwise.
