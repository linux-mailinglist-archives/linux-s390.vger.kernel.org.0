Well, it's a bug (or a bug-in-waiting): even though gup/FOLL_GET works
just as well (and as badly) as ever, pup/FOLL_PIN is required in order
to safely and correctly allow a non-CPU device to operate on a page's
data. Core mm and fs code is going to key off of page_maybe_dma_pinned()
in order to make critical decisions about writeback and umount, and
FOLL_PIN opts into that; FOLL_GET does not.

Basically, you'd be creating another set of call sites that someone
would have to convert to pup/FOLL_PIN.

btw, on the FOLL_LONGTERM documentation above: that's more of an
aspiration than a description of current behavior, in some ways.
The current FOLL_LONGTERM is a little more quirky than is implied
there.

Also on a related note, I've been slow in posting patches to implement
the remaining call site conversions, and am trying to get back to that
asap. There have been some distractions. :) Once every call site is
correctly using gup or pup, it will be easier for everyone.
