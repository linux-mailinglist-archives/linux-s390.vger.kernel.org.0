Right, that's why the *_dma_get_max_cpu_address() functions already walk 
all known bus translations backwards to find the lowest common 
denominator in the CPU address space. In principle we could also 
calculate the lowest translated 32-bit DMA address from every >32-bit 
range in the same way, however that represents enough extra complexity 
that it doesn't seem worth trying to implement unless and until someone 
actually has a clear need for it.

Thanks,
