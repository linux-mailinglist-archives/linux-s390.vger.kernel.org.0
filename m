vfio_ap_mdev_open <-vfio_group_get_device_fd

A plain old file you can open several times over (and thus close
several times over as well). So if you imagine something like:
thread A               thread B
--------               --------
open()
close()                open()
open()                 close()
close()

You may end up with open and close running interleaved. What I'
trying to say is, to my best knowledge, normally there is no
you have to close it before you open it again rule for files.

Does that make sense?

If there is no special mechanism to prevent such a scenario for the
mdev device, I guess, the second open (B) if you like would try to
register a group notifier. I'm not aware of such an mechanism. I 
had a brief look at vfio_group_get_device_fd but couldn't find any
such logic there.

Maybe Connie can actually help us with this one?

Sorry I don't understand. How is the struct matrix_mdev.kvm read
with the matrix_dev->lock mutex locked in:

static void vfio_ap_mdev_release(struct mdev_device *mdev)                      
{                                                                               
        struct ap_matrix_mdev *matrix_mdev = mdev_get_drvdata(mdev);            
                                                                                
        vfio_unregister_notifier(mdev_dev(mdev), VFIO_IOMMU_NOTIFY,             
                                 &matrix_mdev->iommu_notifier);                 
        vfio_unregister_notifier(mdev_dev(mdev), VFIO_GROUP_NOTIFY,             
                                 &matrix_mdev->group_notifier);                 
        vfio_ap_mdev_unset_kvm(matrix_mdev, matrix_mdev->kvm);   <==== HERE!
        module_put(THIS_MODULE);
