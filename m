There is no real way for a guest to enforce the execution order of

VCPU #2: SIGP STOP #3
VCPU #1: SIGP SENSE #3

or

VCPU #1: SIGP SENSE #3
VCPU #2: SIGP STOP #3

without additional synchronization.

There could be random delays in the instruction execution at any point
in time. So the SENSE on #2 might observe "stopped" "not stopped" or
"busy" randomly, because it's inherently racy.


Of course, one could implement some synchronization on top:

VCPU #2: SIGP STOP #3
# VCPU #2 instructs #1 to SIGP SENSE #2
VCPU #1: SIGP SENSE #3
# VCPU #2 waits for SIGP SENSE #2 result from #1
VCPU #2: SIGP SENSE #3

Then, we have to make sure that it cannot happen that #1 observes "not
busy" and #2 observes "busy". But, to implement something like that, #2
has to execute additional instructions to perform the synchronization.

So after SIGP STOP returns on #2 and #2 was able to execute new
instructions, we have to make sure that SIGP SENSE of #3 returns "busy"
on all VCPUs until #3 finished the SIGP STOP.

Right, and the only problematic SIGP orders are really SIGP STOP*,
because these are the only ones that will get processed asynchronously
-- the sending VCPU can return and execute new instructions without the
SIGP STOP order being fully processed.
