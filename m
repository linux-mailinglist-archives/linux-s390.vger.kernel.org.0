I think that's a good thing.  shash was a mistake and I intend to
get rid of it.  But we should not do the ahash conversion right now.
Let me finish adding virtual address support first and then we could
reassess whether this makes sense or not.

If it was possible to shoehorn phmac/paes into a synchronous
algorithm I'd love to do it.  But the fact is that this requires
asynchronous communication in the *unlikely* case which means
that the best way to model is with an optional async interface.

	if (unlikely(crypto_ahash_op(...) == -EINPROGRESS))
		do async
	else
		op completed synchronously

I disagree.  I want the users to start feeding ahash with more
than one unit of input.  So rather than splitting up a folio
into page-size or sector-size units, you feed the whole thing
to ahash and the data should be split up automatically and hashed
in parallel.

The only thing I agree with you here is that an SG list-based input
format is inappropriate.  And that is why I'm adding virtual address
support to ahash (and later to skcipher).

I agree with that completely.  However, what triggered this thread
is in fact something that is not purely software crypto because it
involves system-wide communication which could take seconds to
complete.  The original patch tried to shoehorn this into a
synchronous implementation that would just fail randomly after
waiting.

Cheers,
