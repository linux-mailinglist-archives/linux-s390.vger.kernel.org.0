Sorry for the late reply, Let me describe what problem LoongArch has.

You said that "it feels like this is just a hack to probe an odd
topology". Yes, to some extent you are right.

1, One of our SoC (LS2K3000) has a special device which has func1 but
without func0. To let the PCI core scan func1 we can only make
hypervisor_isolated_pci_functions() return true.
2, In the above case, PCI_SCAN_ALL_PCIE_DEVS has no help.
3, Though we change hypervisor_isolated_pci_functions() to resolve the
above problem, it also lets us pass isolated PCI functions to a guest
OS instance.

As a summary, for real machines commit a02fd05661d73a850 is a hack to
probe an odd device, for virtual machines it allows passing isolated
PCI functions.
