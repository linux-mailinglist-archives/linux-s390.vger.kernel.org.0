Correct, I think we should stick to your approach first, after all it
would allow to keep all the cleverness, and fragment re-use.

In case the "unstable mm" issue turns out to be unsolvable, instead
of my also flawed approach, I guess we would rather take more drastic
measures, and turn to some fundamental change by removing the list
and need for page->lru completely, and not adding back fragments
at all. This is something we already considered before, when working
on the last race fix, in order to reduce complexity, which might
not have such a huge benefit anyway. We probably want to do some
measurements to get a better feeling on possible "memory waste"
effects.

I actually hit the deadlock, CONFIG_PROVE_LOCKING was off, but will
also give it a try with our debug config, that certainly would not be
wrong.

This was the deadlock, on the spin_lock() in __tlb_flush_mm_lazy(),
triggered from finish_arch_post_lock_switch():

I think we want to have that change anyway, might also make sense to put it
in a separate patch. Simply for consistency, even if we are fine ATM, the
current code with mixing spin_lock() and spin_lock_bh() only causes
confusion. I also see no negative impact of that change, and it surely
feels better than a new global lock.

I wasn't, only your original patch, with compile fixes and spin_lock_bh()
changes, and our defconfig.

Not sure if I understood that right, would you want that global
lock as replacement for the current spin_lock() vs. spin_lock_bh()
confusion, or for addressing the "unstable mm" issue? In the first
case, I don't think it would be necessary, using spin_lock_bh()
in all places should be fine.

Pleased to hear that :-)

Taking some closer look at your patch, I also have more questions,
related to page_table_alloc() changes, and also possibly breaking
commit c2c224932fd0:

I do not really see why this is needed, and it also does not seem to
change anything relevant wrt to the bits, only make it less restrictive
by removing the PP bits check. Of course, removing that important-looking
comment also does not feel very good.

I guess it is related either to what you do in pte_free_defer(), or
__tlb_remove_table(), but both places are under spin_lock, and I'm
not sure what this change here is good for (I think I thought I
understood on first review, but not any more, unfortunately this often
happens with this code...)

I guess you did this ...

> -		if (mask & 0x03U)
> +		if (mask & 0x03U)		/* other half is allocated */
>  			list_add(&page->lru, &mm->context.pgtable_list);

... to be able to add this check. But pte_free_defer() and page_table_free()
should never be called for the very same fragment, so (temporarily) setting
the P bit above, and clearing it below, should not cause any conflict with
the P bit set from pte_free_defer(), right?

Of course, the "if (!(mask & 0x30U))" check would always be true if you
did not remove the temporary P bit set above, but I guess that could also
be solved by explicitly checking for the other halves P bit, i.e. instead
of checking for any P bit with 0x30U.

>  			list_del(&page->lru);

This reset of the temporary P bit might need to be moved inside the
spin_lock(), so that pte_free_defer() would observe a consistent state.

The race fix from commit c2c224932fd0 wants to temporarily set the P
bit for this fragment, until after list_del(), to prevent
__tlb_remove_table() from observing zero too early (it currently has no
spin_lock()!) and doing its free_page() in conflict with the list_del().

Not sure if your changes to __tlb_remove_table() changed anything
in that regard, now having access to the spin_lock(). But I also do
not see why the above change would necessarily be needed, and risk
introducing that race again.
