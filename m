 The padata parallel execution mechanism
 =======================================
 
-:Date: December 2019
+:Date: April 2020
 
 Padata is a mechanism by which the kernel can farm jobs out to be done in
-parallel on multiple CPUs while retaining their ordering.  It was developed for
-use with the IPsec code, which needs to be able to perform encryption and
-decryption on large numbers of packets without reordering those packets.  The
-crypto developers made a point of writing padata in a sufficiently general
-fashion that it could be put to other uses as well.
+parallel on multiple CPUs while optionally retaining their ordering.
 
-Usage
-=====
+It was originally developed for IPsec, which needs to perform encryption and
+decryption on large numbers of packets without reordering those packets.  This
+is currently the sole consumer of padata's serialized job support.
+
+Padata also supports multithreaded jobs, splitting up the job evenly while load
+balancing and coordinating between threads.

 It is the user's responsibility to ensure all outstanding jobs are complete
 before any of the above are called.
 
+Running Multithreaded Jobs
+==========================
+
+A multithreaded job has a main thread and zero or more helper threads, with the
+main thread participating in the job and then waiting until all helpers have
+finished.  padata splits the job into units called chunks, where a chunk is a
+piece of the job that one thread completes in one call to the thread function.
+
+A user has to do three things to run a multithreaded job.  First, describe the
+job by defining a padata_mt_job structure, which is explained in the Interface
+section.  This includes a pointer to the thread function, which padata will
+call each time it assigns a job chunk to a thread.  Then, define the thread
+function, which accepts three arguments, ``start``, ``end``, and ``arg``, where
+the first two delimit the range that the thread operates on and the last is a
+pointer to the job's shared state, if any.  Prepare the shared state, which is
+typically a stack-allocated structure that wraps the required data.  Last, call
+padata_do_multithreaded(), which will return once the job is finished.
