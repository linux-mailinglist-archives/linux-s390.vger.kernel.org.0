This seems reasonable.

My starting point for suggesting the new macros was that the current
usage seems to be a historical accident; there doesn't seem to be an
underlying logic to it, except that arch-independent core note types
defined by Linux are named "CORE" ... except when they aren't.

Although the number of exceptional cases is small today, this doesn't
make for a robust rule -- nothing really prevents more unintentional
anomalies being added in future, so it seems prone to bitrot.

If the names are arbitrary, having a table rather than trying to
describe a rule seems the best way to avoid confusion.

Documenting these in a regular way may also encourage people to treat
the name as a formal part of the identifier, rather than a sort of
"comment" that nobody is quite sure what to do with (even if [1] makes
it clear).

That said, software does cope with the situation today; it's just a bit
gross.

What would be the point of these?

#define NN_CORE "CORE" doesn't convey any information at all, though I
suppose it does provide a layer of typo-resistance.

Although not "robust", it should at least be obvious to the eye of
anyone pasting and repurposing an existing snippet of code that the
"type" is probably supposed to match in a single call.

I suppose we could have a kernel helper function containing a big
switch that gives you the name for each recognised note type though.
At the source code level, that would avoid specifying the "NN_"
arguments explicitly.  But if we still want a canonical way to describe
this mapping in elf.h, the "NN_" macros still serve a purpose.


With a literal string instead, I would expect then when adapting

	fill_note(note, NT_SIGINFO, "CORE", ...)

to

	fill_note(note, NT_WIZZFOO, ???, ...)

it's not clear what ??? should be.  I think people have tended to shrug
and just leave it unchanged -- so, it depends on which bit of code was
randomly chosen to serve as a template.  I could be guessing wrongly
about that, but if that's how the name gets chosen for new notes then
it doesn't feel ideal.

Cheers
