Hm but did you observe this 'chained waiting'? And what were the latencies?

Yeah I'm really not sure about that.

Prior to the VMA locks, the mmap write lock would have guaranteed no concurrent
page faults, which is really what fb49c455323ff is about.

So Suren's patch was essentially restoring the _existing_ forking behaviour, and
now you're saying 'let's change the forking behaviour that's been like that for
forever'.

I think you would _really_ have to be sure that's safe. And forking is a very
dangerous time in terms of complexity and sensitivity and 'weird stuff'
happening so I'd tread _very_ carefully here.

To nit pick I think the comment's confusing but also tells you you don't need to
specific anon check - writable private is sufficient. And it's not really just
CoW that's the issue, it's anon_vma population _at all_ as well as CoW.

I think this has to be VM_MAYWRITE, because somebody could otherwise mprotect()
it R/W.

I also don't understand why !mpnt->vm_file for a read-only anon mapping (more
likely PROT_NONE) is here, just do the second check?

(Also please use the new interface, so !vma_test(mpnt, VMA_SHARED_BIT) &&
vma_test(mpnt, VMA_MAYWRITE_BIT))

Technical commentary above is sort of 'just cos' :) because I really question
doing this honestly.

I'd also like to get Suren's input, however.

Thanks, Lorenzo
