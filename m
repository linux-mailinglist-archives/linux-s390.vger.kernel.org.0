At first, I'd turn it into arch_make_folio_accessible(page_folio(page));

Eventually, gup.c needs to become folio-aware.  I haven't spent too much
time thinking about it, but code written like this:

                page = pte_page(pte);
                head = try_grab_compound_head(page, 1, flags);
                if (!head)
                        goto pte_unmap;
                if (unlikely(pte_val(pte) != pte_val(*ptep))) {
                        put_compound_head(head, 1, flags);
                        goto pte_unmap;
                }
                VM_BUG_ON_PAGE(compound_head(page) != head, page);

is just crying out for use of folios.  Also, some of the gup callers
would much prefer to work in terms of folios than individual struct pages
(imagine an RDMA adapter that wants to pin several gigabytes of memory
that's allocated using hugetlbfs for example).

So what you're saying is that the host might allocate, eg a 1GB folio
for a guest, then the guest splits that up into smaller chunks (eg 1MB),
and would only want one of those small chunks accessible to the hypervisor?

Folios can be mapped into userspace at an unaligned offset.  So we still
have to work in pages, at least for now.  We might have some optimised
path for aligned folios later.

Yes, we can do that.  It's what I'm currently doing for
flush_dcache_folio().

Great!

Heh, I see how you got there from the implementors point of view ;-)
I'll move it ...
