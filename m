OK, that should be a way to figure out how userspace deals with the
extra uevents.

Oh, did not know about that interface.

Doesn't the code need to check for 'w' for message subchannels, though?

'dev_busid' looks like a good fit for udev rules; maybe driverctl needs
special-casing? Or does it belong into mdevctl? cc:ing vfio-ccw
maintainers for awareness :)
