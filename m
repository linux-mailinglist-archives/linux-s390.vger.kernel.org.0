Thanks for the link. I did some more investigating and testing. I think
I understand it now but I have to say I did struggle a little with the
whole pci_scan_slot()/next_fn() logic.

The most interesting to me is how I think the following check in
next_fn() actually has multiple uses that weren't clear to me on first
glance:

	/* dev may be NULL for non-contiguous multifunction devices */
	if (!dev || dev->multifunction)
		return (fn + 1) % 8;

First it does cover the case mentioned in the comment where a=20
multifunction device has some functions missing making it non-
contiguous. As I understand it this case is also triggered on s390 when
we "powered off" some of the VFs of a SR-IOV device where both the PFs
and VFs are under the control of Linux but enumeration is done by
firmware and that can hide some of the VFs.

Secondly assuming we have a call of pci_scan_slot(bus, 0) and no ARI
this check also makes sure that the next_fn(bus, dev, 0) call that
initializes fn in the loop returns 0 unless dev->multifunction is set
so we only enter the loop and look for more functions if the devfn 0
device is multifunction. I found this a bit non obvious. Also I
personally don't like that next_fn() returns 0 which is a valid fn to
indicate no more functions and that the handling of the first function
duplicates the code in the loop for the other functions.

The first point also means that your proposal of allowing
dev =3D=3D NULL for the first function if jailhouse_paravirt() respectively
hypervisor_isolated_pci_functions() is set indeed works as far as I can
tell from the s390 case. That made me wonder though. If we instead
unconditionally allow the first function to be missing (dev =3D=3D NULL)
then we don't even need the extra chek for isolated PCI functions. I'm
assuming though we can't do that as we would then waste time scanning
all function of empty downstream ports?

It's a bit of a larger cleanup but I think I will send a patch to
propose changing things around such that the first function is handled
in the loop of pci_scan_slot() too and that next_fn() returns -ENODEV
if there are no more functions. That will also make things more
readable (to me) and commented the cases where we know that we're done
looking. Then a second patch can pull the jailhouse/s390 special case
into pci_scan_slot().

Thanks,
Niklas
