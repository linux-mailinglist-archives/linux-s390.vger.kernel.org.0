I think this makes it even worse.  If userspace cannot match BDFs from
the _INFO ioctl to devices files, for proof of ownership or scope, then
the answer is clearly not "get rid of the device files".

This just seems like nit-picking that the API could have accomplished
this more concisely.  Probably that's true, but I think you've
identified a gap above that amplifies the issue.  If the user cannot
map BDFs to cdevs because the cdevs are passed as open fds to the user
driver, the _INFO results become meaningless and by removing the fds
array, that becomes the obvious choice that a user presented with this
dilemma would take.  We're skipping past easier to misuse, difficult to
use correctly, and circling around no obvious way to use correctly.

Unfortunately the _INFO ioctl does presume that userspace knows the BDF
to device mappings today, so if we are attempting to pre-enable a case
with cdev support where that is not the case, then there must be
something done with the _INFO ioctl to provide scope.  Thanks,

Alex
