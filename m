The claim that kswapd would have already aged these pages is just an
assumption; it is ultimately a matter of timing. We cannot reliably
predict whether kswapd has processed them, nor can we know the future
access patterns of a dying process.

Global system policies are not always optimal for every specific use case.
That is precisely why we have hinting APIs like madvise and fadvise.

While hinting APIs can indeed conflict with global policies, a negative
performance impact would imply that userspace is misusing the API, not
that the optimization itself shouldn't exist.

We should view process_mrelease() (and this flag) as a similar hinting
mechanism where userspace explicitly requests expedited, aggressive reclaim
for a specific target under memory pressure.

While the primary motivation comes from Android's LMKD, this optimization
is not active for normal workloads. It only applies to tasks that are
already being reaped by the OOM reaper or by process_mrelease() with the
special flag (via MMF_UNSTABLE).

Therefore, it is an opt-in or emergency-only behavior that will not hurt
a wider variety of general workloads unless they explicitly use this
targeted reclaim API. Any system with a userspace killer needing fast,
targeted reclaim can benefit from this.
