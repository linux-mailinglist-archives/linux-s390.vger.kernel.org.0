Yes, it will be a zero entry tree now.

I left the flag to indicate that it's an unstable mm, not for faulting
in but to be skipped in OOM events and process_mrelease since neither
should bother doing anything in the window between the dup_mm() failure
and the exit_mmap() window where the write lock was dropped.

We can safely drop the flag now if you want to, because everything has
to deal with an empty vma tree anyways - a race can occur between a call
to unmap everything and the task seg faulting.

I really think this goes back to the life cycle of the mm being somewhat
difficult to figure out.  I'm fine with another flag.

Thanks,
