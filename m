Ok, but that still happens when probe() is called for the driver, right?

How much longer does it stick around?

What happens if this sequence happens:
	- probe()
	- disconnect()
	- probe()
with the same device (i.e. the device is not removed from the system)?

Which can happen as userspace can trigger disconnect() or even worse, if
the driver is unloaded and then loaded again?  Will the second call to
create this directory fail as it is not cleaned up yet?

I can never remember if devm_*() stuff sticks around for the device
lifecycle, or for the driver/device lifecycle, which is one big reason
why I don't like that api...

During probe is a bit too late, but we can handle that as we are used to
it.  If it happens after probe() succeeds, based on something else being
asked for in the driver (like the device being opened), then userspace
has no chance of ever noticing these attributes being added.

But again, this isn't new to your code series, so I wouldn't worry about
it.  Obviously userspace tools do not care or really notice these
attributes at all otherwise the authors of them would have complained
a long time ago :)

So again, no real objection from me here, just meta-comments, except for
the above thing with the devm_* call to ensure that the
probe/disconnect/probe sequence will still work just as well as it does
today.  Should be easy enough to test out by just unloading a module and
then loading it again with this patch series applied.

thanks,
