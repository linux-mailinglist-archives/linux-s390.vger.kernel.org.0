I intend to keep using it, as it's a much better API.  Even if virtual address
support were to be added to ahash, shash will still be a simpler interface that
does not require dynamically allocated per-request memory.

Of course it's possible for it to be a synchronous algorithm.  The proposed user
waits synchronously for the request to complete anyway.

That sort of fits the {dm,fs}-verity use case specifically, but it seems like a
weird hack to avoid the simpler approach that I proposed, and it would introduce
unnecessary restrictions like the input data would have to be a folio.

Yet you continue to push for APIs that are hard to use and slow because they are
designed for an obsolete form of hardware offload and have software crypto
support bolted on as an afterthought.

Sure, but it's possible for it to use the same API.

The async version has that same timeout, so the effect is exactly the same; the
hash operation can fail after a few seconds of waiting.
