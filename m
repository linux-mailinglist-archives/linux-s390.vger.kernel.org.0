We've got the batch of fixes from Mark queued for -rc7:

https://fixes.arm64.dev/

which rely on Peter's patch:

https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/arm64/linux.git/commit/?h=for-next/fixes&id=114e0a684753516ef4b71ccb55a8ebcfa8735edb

There's room for consolidation and cleanup in future, but right now we've
focussed purely on fixing things.
