From what I recall of talking to Andy around that time, when converting
arm64 over, the theory was that over time we'd move more and more out of
thread_info and into task_struct or thread_struct, until task_struct
supplanted thread_info entirely, and that all became generic.

I think the key gain there was making things more *generic*, and there
are other ways we could do that in future without moving more into
task_struct (e.g. with a geenric thread_info and arch_thread_info inside
that).

With that in mind, and given the diffstat, I think this is worthwhile.

FWIW, for the series:
