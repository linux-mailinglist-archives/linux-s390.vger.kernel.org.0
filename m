We have clearly observed that the `fork()` operations of many
popular Android apps, such as iQiyi, Baidu Tieba, and 10086,
end up waiting on page-fault (PF) I/O when the VMA lock is
held during I/O operations. This has already become a
practical issue. I also believe this can lead to chained
waiting, since the global `mmap_lock` blocks all threads that
need to acquire it.

I am afraid not. Before we introduced the per-VMA lock, we
were not performing I/O while holding `mmap_lock`. A page fault
that needed I/O would drop the `mmap_lock` read lock and allow
`fork()` to proceed.

Now, you are suggesting performing I/O while holding the VMA
lock, which changes the requirements and introduces this
problem.

Yep. I think my original proposal did not require any changes
to `fork()`, since it simply preserved the current behavior of
dropping the VMA lock before performing I/O. In that model,
`fork()` would not end up waiting on I/O at all.

What you are suggesting now appears to be performing I/O while
holding the VMA lock, which in turn introduces the need to
change `fork()`.

Yep, I can definitely refine the check further. But before
doing that, I'd first like to confirm that we are aligned on
the direction.

If you still intend to hold the VMA lock while performing I/O,
then I think we should fix `fork()` to avoid taking
`vma_start_write()`.

I think we either need to fix `fork()`, or keep the current
behavior of dropping the VMA lock before performing I/O.

Yes. of course.
