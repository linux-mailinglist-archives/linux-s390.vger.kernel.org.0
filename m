Right, that is an important use case from a driver perspective as it
helps validate the range being attempted for hotplug, before failing.
But then memhp_range_allowed() also uses the same mechanism i.e
memhp_get_pluggable_range() to unify

1. Generic check_hotplug_memory_addressable()
2. Platform checks in arch_add_memory()

This unified function can be called just at the beginning of memory
hotplug so that both (1) and (2) can be dropped all together. This
is just a logical extension which does improve the memory hotplug
implementation (in itself) by failing earlier and while at it, also
unifying generic and platform specific range constraints. Both the
use cases are orthogonal IMHO.
