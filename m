As stated above, the destination guest will be started with the same
QEMU command line as the source guest. Within that command line
will be a '-device' parameter like the following:

-device 
'{"driver":"vfio-ap","id":"hostdev0","sysfsdev":"/sys/bus/mdev/devices/62177883-f1bb-47f0-914d-32a22e3a8804"}

Note that sysfsdev is the path to the mdev named 
62177883-f1bb-47f0-914d-32a22e3a8804;
therefore, the mdev with that name must exist on the destination guest or
the migration will fail with the following error:

error: device not found: mediated device 
'62177883-f1bb-47f0-914d-32a22e3a8804' not found
