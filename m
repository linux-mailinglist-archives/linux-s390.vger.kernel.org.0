Thanks a lot for elaboration. IIUC, implementing migration PMD entry
is *not* prevented from by hardware, it may be very tricky to
implement it, right?

Yes, exactly. The migrate_pages() called by migrate_misplaced_page()
takes care of everything.

Yes, it could be. The old behavior of migration was to return -ENOMEM
if THP migration is not supported then split THP. That behavior was
not very friendly to some usecases, for example, memory policy and
migration lieu of reclaim (the upcoming). But I don't mean we restore
the old behavior. We could split THP if it returns -ENOSYS and the
page is THP.
