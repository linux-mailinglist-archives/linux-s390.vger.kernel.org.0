AFAIK the degradation is consistent.

Frankly I would prefer to avoid IOVAs on the descriptor ring (and the
then necessary translation) for virtio-ccw altogether. But Michael
voiced his opinion that we should mandate F_IOMMU_PLATFORM for devices
that could be used with guests running in protected mode. I don't share
his opinion, but that's an ongoing discussion.

Should we end up having to do translation from IOVA in vhost, we are
very interested in that translation being fast and efficient.

In that sense we would be very happy to test any optimization that aim
into that direction.

Thank you very much for your input!
