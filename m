Hi Greg,

this is for an architecture specific but global i.e. not device bound PCI
attribute. That's why DEVICE_ATTR_* does not work. BUS_ATTR_* would work
but only if we place the attribute directly under /sys/bus/pci/new_attr.

I'm aware that this is quite unusual in fact I couldn't find anything
similar. That's why this is an RFC, with a lengthy cover letter
explaining our use case, that I sent to Bjorn to figure out where to
even place the attribute.

So I guess this is indeed me asking you how to do this properly.
That said it does not show up under /sys/devices/* only /sys/bus/pci/*.

Best regards,
Niklas
