Ah of course, I got confused by freeing pagetable pages vs. the pages
themselves. For the pagetable pages we actually use the generic
tlb_remove_table_(sync_)one, including the IPI-synchronizing
smp_call_function (CONFIG_MMU_GATHER_RCU_TABLE_FREE=y).

The "s390 magic" then only starts in our own __tlb_remove_table,
where we take care of the special 2K vs. 4K pagetable stuff.

Thanks a lot for this very valuable abstract of "who is who and why"
in pagetable memory management :-)

It's all good now, no more occurrences with unlock_page() before
wp_page_reuse().
