I think it does explain why (init/Kconfig): "an arch will need to remove 
all thread_info fields except flags".

IIUC initially the intention with THREAD_INFO_IN_TASK was to remove 
everything from thread_info, but at the end it didn't happen it seems.

It was a pain when implementing that on powerpc, so I really like your 
idea, the series looks good to me.

Yes, if we can avoid yet another config, that's better. We already have 
so many configs that are supposed to be temporary and have lasted for 
years if not decades.
