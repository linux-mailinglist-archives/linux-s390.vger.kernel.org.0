Hi Gerald,

> Is that new WARN_ON_ONCE() in hugetlb_wp() meant to indicate a real bug?

Most probably, unless I am missing something important.

Something triggers FAULT_FLAG_WRITE on a VMA without VM_WRITE and
hugetlb_wp() would map the pte writable.
Consequently, we'd have a writable pte inside a VMA that does not have
write permissions, which is dubious. My check prevents that and bails
out.

Ordinary (!hugetlb) faults have maybe_mkwrite() (e.g., for FOLL_FORCE
or breaking COW) semantics such that we won't be mapping PTEs writable
if the VMA does not have write permissions.

I suspect that either

a) Some write fault misses a protection check and ends up triggering a
FAULT_FLAG_WRITE where we should actually fail early.

b) The write fault is valid and some VMA misses proper flags (VM_WRITE).

c) The write fault is valid (e.g., for breaking COW or FOLL_FORCE) and
we'd actually want maybe_mkwrite semantics.

That's what I suspect. Do you have a backtrace?

Note that I'm on vacation this week and might not reply as fast as usual.
