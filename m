Slots are "interesting" and that code is really old, we know how to do
things better now :)

But I doubt we should change anything there, as it does work, and
userspace is used to how they come/go.

Yes, add your group to that list of groups and all should be good.

No, use the above group you already have please.

No, use the group list as show above please.

What needs to be cleaned up there?

Cleaning up slots is great, but they are "odd", so be careful.
