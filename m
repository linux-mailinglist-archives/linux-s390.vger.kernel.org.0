Sorry for not stating that clearly in this patch. I think the cover
letter of V3 I just sent few minutes ago can answer your question, and I
quote:

"We encountered a boot failure issue in an in-house testing, where the
kernel refused to load its modules since it couldn't verify their
signature. The root cause turned out to be the early return of
load_uefi_certs(), where arch_ima_get_secureboot() returned false
unconditionally due to CONFIG_IMA_SECURE_AND_OR_TRUSTED_BOOT=n, even
though the secure boot was enabled.

This patch set attempts to remove this implicit dependency by shifting
the functionality of efi secure boot enquiry from IMA to the integrity
subsystem, so that both certificate loading and IMA can make use of it
independently."

Here's the link of V3, and please take a look:
https://lore.kernel.org/all/20250703014353.3366268-1-gongruiqi1@huawei.com/T/#mef6d5ea47a4ee19745c5292ab8948eba9e16628d

You're right. I didn't realize it's arch-specific in the first place,
and moving and renaming arch_ima_get_secureboot() turned out to be a
real mess ...

So the V3 keeps the prototype of arch_ima_get_secureboot(), and only
moves out its body, which I think can also better represent the
intention of the patch.

As of the name of the new file, as V3 has been sent earlier and still
uses secureboot.c, I can't change it there. I can do it in V4.
