I explained why in my previous response.

I am not familiar with what a userspace orchestration agent is, so
I can't address that. Can you please describe how that would work?

Maybe it would help to provide the reason for this. For certain types
of crypto operations, a master key must be configured for the crypto
card domain being used. This master key must be synchronized
between the source and destination crypto device so that in-flight
crypto operations can be completed during migration. If these master
keys must be changed, migration must be blocked until the master
key changes can be synchronized between the source and destination
system(s).

So, it appears you are suggesting the creation of a new mdev type
for unmigratable crypto devices. I don't see the value in that.
As I stated above, there is a valid reason for wanting to prevent
migration while master key synchronization is taking place.

If this feature violates the implicit rules of vfio device migration,
then so be it. Maybe we have to figure out another way to ensure
migration is not initiated during master key synchronization.

If we can't find an acceptable means to do this programmatically,
then maybe it will come down to a matter of documenting the
need to ensure migration is not initiated while master key
synchronization is taking place. This would put the onus on the
various system administrators responsible for host, guest and
master key administration to communicate out of band to
ensure they are all on the same page with regard to migration.

It would be preferable to be able to do this with a userspace
interface, so any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
