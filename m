I did not get a chance to review this in time but if a v2 shows up,
I'll at least run it through a battery of tests to measure the impact
and hopefully find the time to do a proper review. Superficially I'm not
opposed to using generic code for migration because even if it shows up a
problem, it would be better to optimise the generic implementation than
carry two similar implementations. I'm undecided on whether s390 should
split+migrate rather than skip because I do not have a good overview of
"typical workloads on s390 that benefit from NUMA balancing".
