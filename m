No problem. ;-)

Sure, the checksum would have to be recalculated after setting CRASHTIME. B=
ut that's perfectly possible.

Yes, to some extent. The reason I asked was that I also implemented parsing=
 of OS_INFO_VMCOREINFO in libkdumpfile a few years ago, but it has no test =
coverage. So, I looked around a bit and to my surprise all dump files conta=
ined a NULL pointer there, which looked somewhat suspicious.

Anyway, if nobody knows for certain, then my plan is to add the necessary c=
ode to the Linux kernel. Patch coming soon on the mailing list. ;-)

Thanks,
Petr T
