First, as I've mentioned, the SHA-3 crypto_shash algorithms will
eventually need to be reimplemented on top of the library.  We shouldn't
have two competing SHA-3 implementations in the kernel.  So
sha3_generic.c will get replaced soon anyway.

Second, this patch already makes changes to the SHA-3 code and doesn't
simply copy it.  Cleaning up some additional small things like incorrect
comments would make sense, similar to how you've also cleaned up the
endianness handling.  If you'd like for it to instead be a simple copy
followed by a separate cleanup patch, that could be okay too, but the
submission would need to be organized that way.

These are just functions.  The first priority should be kerneldoc, as
that's where most people will look.  Documention/crypto/ maybe could
contain a high-level overview of the various hash function APIs (not
just SHA-3), but it should not be duplicative of the kerneldoc and it
doesn't eliminate the need to write high-quality kerneldoc.

A cryptographic flaw can be as bad or worse than a crash.  We need to
design APIs that are easy to use correctly and hard to use incorrectly.

Citation needed.

How about reviewing the specs and seeing what terms are used?  It's not
about what makes me happy, but rather about using standard terminology.

That should go in the KUnit test suite.
