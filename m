Agreed.  Which is why I have this commit queued:

f8d5aaaf90f8 ("srcu: Don't queue workqueue handlers to never-online CPUs")

This is currently slated for the upcoming merge window, but if you
need it sooner, please let us know.  Please see the end of this email
for the full commit.

commit f8d5aaaf90f8294890802ce8dccbafd9850ac5f9
Author: Paul E. McKenney <paulmck@kernel.org>
Date:   Thu Apr 9 11:16:02 2026 -0700

    srcu: Don't queue workqueue handlers to never-online CPUs
    
    While an srcu_struct structure is in the midst of switching from CPU-0
    to all-CPUs state, it can attempt to invoke callbacks for CPUs that
    have never been online.  Worse yet, it can attempt in invoke callbacks
    for CPUs that never will be online due to not being present in the
    cpu_possible_mask.  This can cause hangs on s390, which is not set up to
    deal with workqueue handlers being scheduled on such CPUs.  This commit
    therefore causes Tree SRCU to refrain from queueing workqueue handlers
    on CPUs that have not yet (and might never) come online.
    
    Because callbacks are not invoked on CPUs that have not been
    online, it is an error to invoke call_srcu(), synchronize_srcu(), or
    synchronize_srcu_expedited() on a CPU that is not yet fully online.
    However, it turns out to be less code to redirect the callbacks
    from too-early invocations of call_srcu() than to warn about such
    invocations.  This commit therefore also redirects callbacks queued on
    not-yet-fully-online CPUs to the boot CPU.
