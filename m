The main concern I have with current code is that it makes it impossible
for some driver to detect which ranges it could actually later hotplug.
You cannot warn about a strange setup before you actually run into the
issues while trying to add memory. Like returning "-EINVAL" from a
function but not exposing which values are actually valid.

If we have memhp_get_pluggable_range(), we have such a mechanism and

1. Trying to add out-of-range memory will fail (although deep down in
arch code, but at least it fails).

2. There is a way for drivers to find out which values are actually
valid before triggering 1.

For my use case that's good enough. Do you have others in mind that
require new checks in common code (meaning inside add_memory() and friends)?
