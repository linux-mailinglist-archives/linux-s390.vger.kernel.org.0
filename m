This warning only shows up for the decompressor code and purgatory which
have separate set of build flags not derived from top level KBUILD_CFLAGS.
For the rest of the code this warning is suppressed by:
Makefile:
 740 ifdef CONFIG_CC_IS_CLANG
...
 744 # Quiet clang warning: comparison of unsigned expression < 0 is always false
 745 KBUILD_CFLAGS += -Wno-tautological-compare

At the same time both decompressor and purgatory Makefiles include
CLANG_FLAGS into their CFLAGS. And this -Wno-tautological-compare is
clang specific. So I believe this option belongs to CLANG_FLAGS
rather than being included into KBUILD_CFLAGS under ifdef
CONFIG_CC_IS_CLANG. But this raises question about other clang
specific options inside that ifdef CONFIG_CC_IS_CLANG. Should they all
be made part of CLANG_FLAGS?
