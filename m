We use passthrough mode of the vIOMMU to negate that overhead for guest
drivers and vfio drivers have typically learned by now that dynamic
mappings using the vfio type1 mapping API are a bad idea.

Sure, the VM itself is still isolated by the host IOMMU, but it's
clearly an extra maintenance and development burden when we should
instead be encouraging those use cases to use vIOMMU rather than
porting to a different noiommu uAPI.  Even if the host is not exposed,
any sort of security and support best practices in the guest should
favor a vIOMMU solution.

What claims do you have to support lack of robustness in vIOMMU?  Can
they be fixed?

> Perhaps yes if group may be deprecated in future.

Deprecation is going to take a long time.  IMO, the VM use cases should
all be encouraged to adopt a vIOMMU solution rather than port to a new
cdev noiommu interface.  The question then is whether there are ongoing
bare metal noiommu use cases and how long those will drag out the vfio
group deprecation.  We could always add noiommu to the native vfio cdev
interface later if there's still demand.

If we're only continuing the group compat noiommu support, I can't very
well require new documentation.  We have a simple model there, noiommu
devices only support the noiommu container type and provide no mapping
interfaces.  The iommufd interface relative to noiommu seems more
nuanced and probably needs to documentation should we decide to pursue
it. Thanks,
