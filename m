Thanks, Cornelia, that's a very valid point, I didn't see it from this 
perspective yet, but it sounds like the right way to handle this. So I think 
my patch should be applied, and if we then agree that the module should not 
be auto-loaded by default, it should be handled with the appropriate changes 
in userspace instead.
