Then you are doing something wrong :)

Where _exactly_ are you wanting to put this attribute?

Do NOT put random kobjects under a bus subsystem.  If you need that,
then use BUS_ATTR_* as that is what it is there for.

Again, if you are in a driver subsystem, do not use a raw kobject.
Either something is already there for you, or what you want to do is not
correct :)
