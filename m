It looks mostly OK, a few comments below.

There's some info on using qemu here:
  https://github.com/linuxppc/wiki/wiki/Booting-with-Qemu

But I'm not sure where you get a version of kexec that uses kexec_file().

We can probably work out those details though.

That will work for you but could cause us problems if we have any
changes that touch that code.

It's easy enough to create a topic branch with just that patch that both
of us merge.

We could probably just call it KEXEC_ELF I think? The functions are
called that after all.

Please don't remove that, there are still some prints left in this file
that use it.

This is unused AFAICS. We should probably remove it explicitly rather
than as part of this patch.

You shouldn't be adding new license text. Instead remove those two
paragraphs and use a SPDX tag.

If you look at the file in master it already has the tag.

You don't need that do you?

Or that.

Why are we doing that rather than just using elf64_to_cpu directly?

And that?



cheers
