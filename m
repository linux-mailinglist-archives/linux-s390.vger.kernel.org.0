Hello Dear,

Please forgive me for contacting you in this manner,It because I am in
desperate in need of your assistance,My Name is Melinda Bote, the wife
of Ferdinand Bote, My Husband was a Politician an a mayor Who was
killed in philippine in a city of General Tinio ,by some gunmen on
Tuesday 3 July 2018.

Well during the threat on my late husband life, he gave me the total
sum of (US$4.3 Million) for the up keeping/future of  our children and
asks me to deposit it in a security finacial firm in abroad just in
case anything ever happen to him.

Since the death of my late husband,the philippines government has
blocked I and my late husband accounts through the helps of  my late
husband family.And Also my late husband brothers has succeeded in
collecting all our landed assets that is under my control and they are
still looking for more. I am contacting you because I want you to help
me in securing this sum That I deposited in a security firm for the
future of my children before my late husband family sees the deposit
document and start going for it. Since they have made it impossible
for me to move out of my late husband house for now.


Please do tell me if i can trust you as who will not sit on this sum
when you claim it. As am willing to give you 15% of the total sum
after you have successfully secured the fund for your kind assistance
to me.

Best regards.

Mrs.Melinda Bote.
