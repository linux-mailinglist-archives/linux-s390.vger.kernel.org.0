Yep, good point.

The patch in question puts says that you now need to do something to the
page before it can be accessed by the kernel.  Because this is
presumably anonymous-only, and the only main way to get to anonymous
pages is the page tables, and the gup code is our de facto user page
table walker, this works OK-ish.

But, the gup code isn't out only walker.  Grepping for pte_page() finds
a bunch of sites that this approach misses.  They'll theoretically each
have to be patched if we want to extend this gup-time approach for
anything other than anonymous, small pages.

(Most of the additional pte_page() sites are for huge pages, which can't
be protected on s390.)

I assumed that this was all anonymous-only so it's always dirty before
writeback starts.

Yeah, we would ideally fail it, but not at the current
arch_make_page_acesssible() site.  If the PTE isn't usable, we shouldn't
be creating it in the first place, or shouldn't leave it Present=1 and
GUP'able in the page tables once the underlying memory is no longer
accessible.

I _think_ vm_normal_page() is the right place to do it, when we're
dealing with a PTE but don't yet have a 'struct page'.

Yes, and the keys can't even be used unless you are inside the VM.

But this begs the question: why did we create PTEs which can't be used?
 Just to have something to gup?

To me, that's the entire *point* of get_user_pages().  It's someone
saying: "I want to find out what this mapping does, but I actually can't
use *that* mapping."  I'm either:

1. A device that does I/O to the paddr space or through an IOMMU, or
2. The kernel but I want access to that page via *another* mapping (if
   we could use the gup'd mapping, we would, but we know we can't)

and I need the physical address space to stay consistent for a bit so I
can do those things via other address spaces.
