Apologises for the delay in responding to this, things got delayed a
bit with the Easter break. Since then, Will and I have been discussing
this series and what it means for the future of the arm64 port.

By way of opening the discussion, we want to be clear that we are
supportive of the effort. Our comments here should be seen as areas of
potential improvement and not as rejection of what you are trying to
achieve.

* Code movement:

  The patches you have posted demonstrate that it is possible to
  expose a large amount of arm64-specific code and definition to s390,
  and yet still manage to build both architectures without regression.
  However, the result looks rather messy and may adversely affect
  maintainability on the arm64 side.

  The moving of files into shared locations is particularly painful,
  and gets in the way of overall maintainability. Not only does it
  break our comfortable habits, it makes the backporting of fixes
  harder.  Importantly, these changes come with no benefit on the
  arm64 side.

  Would it be possible to try some other means of reaching the
  arm64-specific files *in situ*, either by making use of relative
  paths, or by using symbolic links? Even better, files that are
  generated on arm64 (such as the sysreg definitions) should equally
  be generated for s390, locally to the s390 part of the tree.

  But that doesn't mean that we consider that the arm64 tree is
  immutable and that we are not open to change, quite the opposite.
  Most of the KVM/arm64 include files are an unholy mix of arch
  definitions, data structures that have some arch relevance, but also
  code and data that is strictly implementation specific. Splitting
  these (as you already have for some include files) could both help
  with sharing what is actually needed, keep the arm64-specific stuff
  at bay, *and* benefit arm64's overall maintainability. We would need
  some tooling to enforce the split and avoid regressing it, something
  that could happen quickly given the level of activity on arm64. Yet
  another way to achieve this could be to mechanically process the
  arm64 files as part of the s390 build to extract the relevant
  information, and we could help with this.

  Looking a bit more into the distance, it is likely that KVM/arm64
  will grow feature support quicker than s390 can absorb them, and
  that some feature won't ever make any sense of s390 (pKVM, for
  example).  We need to establish how these features can be built
  without arm64 being hindered by s390. This is also true when adding
  architectural support for features that don't exist in the s390 view
  of arm64.

* UAPI and guest API:

  Obviously, one of our biggest concerns is the userspace API. We
  appreciate that you want to reuse it as it is, warts and all, and
  directly incorporate additional feature support as it becomes
  available. This means that, should any divergence in UAPI appear,
  the source of truth must be on the arm64 side. This has the
  following consequences:

    - s390 cannot add extensions to the UAPI

    - s390 must be compatible with all future arm64 extensions

  Similar concerns exist on the guest/hypervisor API, including:

  - errata mitigation: this is unsurprisingly a hot topic, which keeps
    causing us some massive headaches. We are particularly concerned
    about errata that need to be disclosed to the guest and acted upon
    via a hypercall. Should there be a need for those, how will we
    coordinate the deployment of such hypercall?

    The way it has been deployed so far is that PSCI has grown an
    errata discovery mechanism. ARM assigns function numbers and
    specifies what these hypercalls mitigate. KVM, in turn, takes part
    in implementing the mitigation. We expect that s390 would follow
    the same behaviour, including coordination with ARM for the
    function numbering.

  - device assignment: this is unknown territory for us, as we
    commonly use vfio-pci (and more occasionally vfio-platform). How
    would that look for an arm64 guest on s390?

  - s390-specific ISA extension: although we obviously cannot control
    how you will decide to expose features to your arm64 guests,
    KVM/arm64 makes a point of forbidding any use of implementation
    specific instruction or system registers. We expect the s390
    implementation to uphold this.

  - s390-specific hypercalls: aside from the errata handling
    mentioned above, we would very much like to avoid anything that is
    implementation specific, and keep the hypercall space as small as
    possible. In other words, an unenlightened arm64 guest must work
    and continue to work.

* Overall maintenance

  Unsurprisingly, we are not totally familiar with s390. To say that
  there is a learning gap would only be an understatement. So how do
  we make sure we don't break things out of pure ignorance? Is there
  any documentation we can refer to when hacking on code that will
  eventually run on your side of the computing universe?

  We need to be able to build and test what we produce. How do we go
  about that? We appreciate that you may not be in a position to help
  with this right now, but at least having a plan would be reassuring.
  This should include things like automatic testing of our CI branches.
  We are happy to test build s390 as part of our maintenance flow, if
  pointed to existing binary toolchains compiled for arm64 and x86,
  together with a typical configuration.

  What about debugging? We expect that you'd have to help, should an
  arm64 change cause a regression on s390, as it is fairly unlikely
  that we would be able to reproduce it.

  Finally, we feel it would be beneficial for both projects to swap
  prisoners and have cross-reviewers in MAINTAINERS, so that there is
  an s390 reviewer added to KVM/arm64, and an arm64 reviewer added to
  KVM/s390.

It probably would be beneficial to work through some of these things
face-to-face. Maybe around LPC or KVM Forum if you manage to get
there? Or some other place/time?

Thanks,

	Marc and Will
