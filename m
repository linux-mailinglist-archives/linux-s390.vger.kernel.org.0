Yeah that's an itneresting approach actually, sorry if I missed that.

Yeah, and honestly I'm beginning to wonder if we don't just have to pay the
complexity tax anyway and eat the fact we have to deal with that.

But as per Josef's comment re: this whole mechanism, simply not waiting for
file-backed I think is another option (but I don't recall where we left that
conversation actually?)

Anyway I want to make sure any complexity we add is necessary so will take a
look through patches and have a think (and obviously others will have their own
opinions!)

Right yeah, good to have more options.

Yes, sorry, I maybe was a bit too harsh in my tone here, I didn't really intend
to be negative as to addresisng the problem as a whole.

Moreso I've been concerned about the fork approach, and that is what's led to me
being shall we say 'emphatic' about it :)

But of course I sometimes make mistakes in quite how my tone comes across, so
apologies if it came across overly negatively - I am negative (on a technical
level) about the fork approach, but not the fact we should address this.

To be clear - I'm very glad you've brought this up, it's important, as much as
it's painful that we have this issue in the first place! :)

Yeah :) one day maybe we can get rid of it altogether (maybe I'm dreaming :)
