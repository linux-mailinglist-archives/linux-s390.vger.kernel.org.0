If by tooling you are referring to libvirt and/or quemu, then I agree;
this is an artifact of tooling. According to
https://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Migration#Requirements,
"the guest on the destination must be started the same way it was
started on the source". s390 guests are run under qemu, so the
qemu command line used to start the source guest will also be used
to start the destination guest. To pass through
AP devices to the guest, the mediated device that provides the guest's
AP configuration - i.e., the crypto devices to which the guest is granted
access - must be identified on the qemu command line. As stated
previously, the following qemu command line parameter is included
for this purpose:


-device '{"driver":"vfio-ap","id":"hostdev0","sysfsdev":"/sys/bus/mdev/devices/62177883-f1bb-47f0-914d-32a22e3a8804"}

When the qemu command is used to start the destination guest, the same
qemu command line will be used to start it. As such, qemu will try to open
an fd for that device. If the mdev with UUID does not exist, the migration
will fail. In other words, I don't think the guest can be started with any
arbitrary UUID. Am I wrong about this?

In any case, it is probably not relevant to mention this for this patch 
series
since it is not a KVM/kernel requirement, so I will remove it from the
cover-letter description.

I understand your view on this and have already agreed to remove
the new uAPI.
