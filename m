Something to fix in QEMU too, I think.

We'd never clear it though - why would we?

Looking at it some more, I see that vhost-user actually
does not send features to the backend until FEATURES_OK.
However, the code in contrib for vhost-user-blk at least seems
broken wrt endian-ness ATM. What about other backends though?
Hard to be sure right?
Cc Raphael and Stefan so they can take a look.
And I guess it's time we CC'd qemu-devel too.

For now I am beginning to think we should either revert or just limit
validation to LE and think about all this some more. And I am inclining
to do a revert. These are all hypervisors that shipped for a long time.
Do we need a flag for early config space access then?

Right.

Or maybe if we will go down that road just the verify check (for
performance). I'm a bit unhappy we have the extra exit but consistency
seems more important.

Well we established that we can know. Here's an alternative explanation:

	The virtio specification virtio-v1.1-cs01 states:

	Transitional devices MUST detect Legacy drivers by detecting that
	VIRTIO_F_VERSION_1 has not been acknowledged by the driver.
	This is exactly what QEMU as of 6.1 has done relying solely
	on VIRTIO_F_VERSION_1 for detecting that.

	However, the specification also says:
	driver MAY read (but MUST NOT write) the device-specific
	configuration fields to check that it can support the device before
	accepting it.

	In that case, any device relying solely on VIRTIO_F_VERSION_1
	for detecting legacy drivers will return data in legacy format.
	In particular, this implies that it is in big endian format
	for big endian guests. This naturally confuses the driver
	which expects little endian in the modern mode.

	It is probably a good idea to amend the spec to clarify that
	VIRTIO_F_VERSION_1 can only be relied on after the feature negotiation
	is complete. However, we already have regression so let's
	try to address it.

An empty line before tags.

Let's add more commits that are affected. E.g. virtio-net with MTU
feature bit set is affected too.

So let's add Fixes tag for:
commit 14de9d114a82a564b94388c95af79a701dc93134
Author: Aaron Conole <aconole@redhat.com>
Date:   Fri Jun 3 16:57:12 2016 -0400

    virtio-net: Add initial MTU advice feature
    
I think that's all, but pls double check me.
