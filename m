Hi Narendra,

the reasoning behind the wish to reuse index is that we think it's
similar in the sense that it provides a stable, firmware-reported
interface identifier.
Some background: s390 is a highly virtualized platform. There's
no traditional bare metal mode of operation, neither for the computer
system nor the I/O subsystem.
The equivalent to a standalone system is a logical partition (LPAR)
which in essence is a kind of virtual machine. LPARs access I/O devices
in a virtualized fashion as well. E.g., for PCI devices the I/O
subsystem is responsible for the management of PCI hardware and
will provide the PCI functions to the LPARs.
This is where UID and function_id come into play. Each PCI function will
carry a function_id attribute which defines it uniquely within the
entire s390 system. If a UID is configured for the function, it must
be unique within an LPAR, but doesn't need to be unique system-wide.
For instance, the admistrator may want to ensure that for every
LPAR the primary ethernet interface has the same identifier, to
allow miigration of Linux instances accross LPARs.
This can't be achieved with a slot-based name.

Yes, the UID is the primary identifier for a PCI function and part of
the LPAR configuration. Even hotplug will not change the UID.

No, this is independent. The commit above fixes the slot name parsing.

As I wrote above, the slot describes the PCI function at the system
level, whereas the uid/index does it in the context off the LPAR.
