Got it now, thanks for explaining it.

My opinion is that a help text is there to help the user, and in my experience
an inaccurate help text can be very frustrating - think comments that say
one thing, and the code does something else.

How about this:

diff --git a/configure b/configure
index 3ab0ec208e10..5dbe189816b2 100755
--- a/configure
+++ b/configure

 usage() {
+    [ -z "$processor" ] && processor=$(get_default_processor $arch)
     cat <<-EOF
        Usage: $0 [options]

        Options include:
            --arch=ARCH            architecture to compile for ($arch). ARCH can be one of:
                                   arm, arm64/aarch64, i386, ppc64, riscv32, riscv64, s390x, x86_64
-           --processor=PROCESSOR  processor to compile for ($default_processor). For arm and arm64, the
+           --processor=PROCESSOR  processor to compile for ($processor). For arm and arm64, the
                                   value 'max' is special and it will be passed directly to
                                   qemu, bypassing the compiler. In this case, --cflags can be
                                   used to compile for a specific processor.

Should be accurate enough, as far as I can tell. And I don't think there's
a need for $do_help: if the user does ./configure --help --arch=arm64, then
I think it's reasonable to expect that --help will be interpreted before
--arch is parsed.

Thanks,
Alex
