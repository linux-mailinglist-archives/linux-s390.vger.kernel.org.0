Is this just a limitation of s390's TCG implementation or in general?
Our CI runs on GitHub Actions, which does not support virtualization so
I believe that all of our tests are being done with TCG and x86_64
passes just fine:

https://github.com/ClangBuiltLinux/continuous-integration2/runs/3473222334?check_suite_focus=true

Good to hear that it is working on bare metal now though, we could still
enable build testing of it at a minimum but it would be nice to see the
tests pass even in QEMU :)

Cheers,
Nathan
