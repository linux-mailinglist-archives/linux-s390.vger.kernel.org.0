I discovered what the problem is here. The patch is based on our
master branch along with the two pre-requisite patches that were
recently reviewed and are currently being merged. The two patches
of which I speak are:
* [PATCH v6 1/2] s390/vfio-ap: clean up mdev resources when remove 
callback invoked
    Message ID: <20210621155714.1198545-2-akrowiak@linux.ibm.com>

* [PATCH v6 2/2] s390/vfio-ap: r/w lock for PQAP interception handler 
function pointer
    <20210621155714.1198545-3-akrowiak@linux.ibm.com>

I probably should have included those along with this one.

This patch was in response to the following review comments made by Jason
Gunthorpe:

* Message ID: <20210525162927.GC1002214@nvidia.com>
    "... the kvm_busy should be replaced by a proper rwsem,
     don't try to open code locks like that - it just defeats lockdep
     analysis".

* Message ID: <20210527112433.GX1002214@nvidia.com>
    "Usually when people start open coding locks it is often
    because lockdep complained. Open coding a lock makes
    lockdep stop because the lockdep code
    is removed, but it doesn't fix anything. The kvm_busy
    should be replaced by a proper rwsem, don't try to
    open code locks like that - it just defeats lockdep
    analysis."

I will paraphrase and include the information from Jason's
comments in the description.
