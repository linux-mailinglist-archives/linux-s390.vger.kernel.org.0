I don't know why you keep harping on module locking. I didn't
write the original code, so I really have no idea why that was
incorporated. The question wasn't in response to module
locking, it's just something that popped into my head at the
time because based on my observations, the remove callback
did not get invoked in response to a user removing the mdev
via the sysfs interface until the mdev fd was closed by the
guest.

I'd have to look into it more, but my initial thought is that this is
not true. If what I observed is true - i.e., the mdev remove callback
won't get invoked until the mdev fd is closed by the guest - then the
matrix_mdev will never get freed while the pqap_hook is not NULL
because the mdev release callback - invoked when the mdev fd is
closed - nullifies it. That is why I asked whether there is any other
way that the mdev remove callback gets invoked other than
when a user removes it via the sysfs remove attribute. Keep in mind,
the matrix_mdev is removed under the matrix_dev->lock. If retrieve
the matix_mdev in the interception handler from the matrix_dev->mdev_list
under the matrix_dev->lock - instead of from the pqap_hook or the
container_of macro - and exit the handler if it has been removed,
then I think the race issue can be avoided.

Actually, the matrix_mdev is the issue. If the handle_pqap
callback is invoked after the matrix_mdev is freed, then
because we retrieve it from the pqap_hook structure or
even if we retrieve it from the enclosing container, the
interception handler is screwed.

As I said earlier, I don't know why the author did this. My best guess
is that he wanted to ensure that the module was still loaded; otherwise,
the data structures contained therein - for example, the pqap_hook
and matrix_mdev that contains it - would be gonzo.

Since reading the various review comments related to this patch,
I started working on something along the lines of that which
you propose. I will post a new set of patches, probably tomorrow.
