Is this entirely the fault of re-entering the page fault? Under extreme
memory pressure, even if we map the pages, they can still be reclaimed
quickly?

If we need to protect the page from being reclaimed too early, the fix
should reside within LRU management, not in page fault handling.

Also, I gave an example where we may not drop the VMA lock if the folio is
already up to date. That likely corresponds to waiting for the PTE mapping =
to
complete.

I am concerned that other write paths may still need to modify the VMA, for
example during splitting. Tail latency has long been a significant issue fo=
r
Android users, and we have observed it even with folio_lock, which has much
finer granularity than the VMA lock.

While I agree that there are other approaches worth exploring, I
remain entirely unconvinced that this patchset is the wrong
direction. With the current retry logic, it substantially reduces
mmap_lock acquisitions and represents a clear low-hanging fruit.

Also, I am not referring to landing the RFC itself, but to a subsequent for=
mal
patchset that retries using the per-VMA lock.

Thanks
