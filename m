I see callers? Am I imagining them? :)

Right, yes the mmap read lock is required for that.

Err the page tables? All the other cases which require page table copying?

Concurrent faults mean that copy_page_range() and faulting with vma->anon_vma
_or_ any of the multiple cases mentioned elsewhere.

And who knows what else serialises on that.

I like how you hand wave the VMA lock operations in madvise() :)

(Maybe) guard regions being present cause page tables to be copied, they're
installed under VMA (read) lock, and can race now.

And it sets traps for future changes - introducing more horrible edge case race
conditions in fork is just a big nope nope nope.

This isn't an area to play around in.

As above that'd be totally broken. NAK.
