[Greg may be able to help compare/contrast this s390 UID with udev
persistent names]

I'm a little wary of using the PCI geographical address
("0000:01:00.0") as a stable name.  Even if you can make a way to use
that to identify a specific device instance, regardless of how it is
plugged in or passed through, it sounds like we could end up with
"physical PCI addresses" and "virtual PCI addresses" that look the
same and would cause confusion.

This concept sounds similar to the udev concept of a "persistent
device name".  What advantages does this s390 UID have over the udev
approach?

There are optional PCI device serial numbers that we currently don't
really make use of.  Would that be a generic way to help with this?
