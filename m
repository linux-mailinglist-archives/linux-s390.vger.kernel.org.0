I don't think that's clear.

Yes, exactly, it MAY read before accepting features. How does the device
know whether the config space is little-endian or not?

No, that would defeat the entire purpose of verify. After
virtio_finalize_features(), we are done with feature negotiation.

No, that commit is not really flawed on its own, I think the whole
procedure may be problematic.

We probably need to special-case VERSION_1 to move at least forward;
i.e. proceed as if we accepted it when reading the config space.

The problem is that we do not know what the device assumes when we read
the config space prior to setting FEATURES_OK. It may assume
little-endian if it offered VERSION_1, or it may not. The spec does not
really say what happens before feature negotiation has finished.

There might be other bits in the future that change how the config space
works. We cannot assume that any of those bits will be accepted if
offered; i.e. we need a special hack for VERSION_1.

This is a mess. For starters, we need to think about if we should do
something in the spec, and if yes, what.. Then, we can probably think
about how to implement that properly.

As we have an error right now that is basically a regression, we
probably need a band-aid to keep going. Not sure if your patch is the
right approach, maybe we really need to special-case VERSION_1 (the
"assume we accepted it" hack mentioned above.) This will likely fix the
reported problem (I assume that is s390x on QEMU); do we know about
other VMMs? Any other big-endian architectures?

Anyone have any better suggestions?
