Thanks for this tip and sorry for bothering you again.

Oh ok, I got this idea from the code adding /sys/bus/pci/slots/ in
drivers/pci/slot.c:pci_slot_init(). See below maybe we can clean that up too.

I'm probably missing something but I don't get how this could work in
this case. If I'm seeing this right the default attribute group here
is pci_bus_type.bus_groups and that is already set in drivers/pci/pci-driver.c
so I don't think I should set that.

I did however find bus_create_file() which does work when using the path
/sys/bus/pci/uid_checking instead. This would work for us if Bjorn is okay with
that path and the code is really clean and simple too.

That said, I think we could also add something like bus_create_group().
Then we could use that to also clean up drivers/pci/slot.c:pci_slot_init()
and get the original path /sys/bus/pci/zpci/uid_checking.

I think this would also allow us to get rid of pci_bus_get_kset() which is
only used in that function and seems to me like it encourages use of raw ksets.
Or I'm completely off the mark and just missing something important.

thanks,
Niklas
