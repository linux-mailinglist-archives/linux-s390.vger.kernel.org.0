Yes, we can do that. Our first iteration had an extensive use of symlinks for
headers. We feared that this approach would gain no big support as it was
quite messy and gave a lot of surface for future errors. So we moved to the
current implementation. For the non-KVM headers I could see moving back to the
symlink approach to reduce the backport & maintainability burden for you.
Preferably, those headers are kept clean of any arm implementation specific
things (e.g. sysreg vs sysreg-defs).

For shared kvm headers and code, we think moving them to the proposed location
helps reducing regression issues when someone changes a function as that
location makes it 100% clear that this is shared code. Tagging a file 
as __shared__ by other means (e.g. by a file name suffix) may 
be OK for us as well if that reduces your maintenance burden.

The generated (e.g. sysreg) definitions are already generated into the s390
tree:
{outdir}/arch/s390/include/generated/asm/sysreg-gen-defs.h
We just reuse the makefile definitions from arm.

As a side note: We tried to reuse as much arm code as possible - to not
reinvent the wheel - while keeping the arm churn minimal. While going through
the arm code, we tried to spot parts that could benefit from refactoring and
did that. By moving especially the kvm code to another location we wanted to
emphasize that this code is shared between arm and s390 and possibly other
architectures in the future.

We will prototype alternatives including using symlinks and post them soon here.

That is good to hear. We of course also wanted arm to improve with our changes.

Yes, of course s390 should not hinder arm64 to progress. 120% agree! We will
be available in case that happens. However, I do not think this is a big
problem. By defining some arm feature macros to false we already did turn off
few arm features for us at compile time. Compiler optimization is a very good
friend here.

Yes, implementing the arm64 kvm-UAPI was one of our primary goals so that we
can reuse existing arm64 VMMs e.g. Qemu.

Yes, arm64 is the source of truth for us. That is the exact reason we did not
copy the (UAPI) headers but moved & share them.

Yes. s390 will follow those things. We are planning to reuse the complete 
arm hypercall code including the current (and future) errata detection that
comes with it.
This change will come in one of the future series.

We plan to work with virtio-pci and vfio-pci. No plans to assign ccw devices to
 arm guests.

We have no plans of using private ISA extensions or deviations.

Of course an unenlightened arm64 guest must keep working and it should
work with good performance and usability. This is another primary goal of
this project.
Given that we have some history of paravirtual optimizations on s390, we 
might propose some hypercalls in the future. But this will then very likely to
the benefit of all arm platforms and implemented on both host variants.

I am aware of the Kernel Documentation for s390.
Also, for the z/Architecture in general:
Principles of Operation might be a good start to learn about s390 architecture.

Of course we will be available for answering s390 architecture questions.

For your side:
Cross compiling the kernel is a good starting point. GCC/Clang cross compile
toolchains for s390 are available on all major distros. They are typically
postfixed with ‘-s390x-linux-gnu‘, note the x after s390. defconfig has KVMARM
in it - this should be suitable for testing you do not break s390 compilation.

You can get access to s390 resources for doing native builds in the LinuxONE
community cloud. Those are VMs itself -> run tests are not possible.
https://community.ibm.com/zsystems/l1cc
They also offer permanent access to OSS communities if necessary. We can help
to connect you with those teams.

Another option would be to spin-up a s390 qemu-tcg guest to build the kernel
'native'.

For us:
Yes we are planning to do regular tests to prevent breaking arm. Testing your
CI branches seems to be a good starting point for this. Do you have a few
pointers which are suited best?

Positive, we will do whatever we can to support you in any way.

Great Idea and I like the wording :)
We’ll start with the exchange. I (Steffen) would volunteer to be sent over to you.
I will add myself as kvm/arm64 reviewer in v2 of this series if that is OK for
you.

For the other way we appreciate any volunteers and also will ask around for suitable
people with arm and preferably also s390 knowledge.

Totally agree, although I would prefer an earlier date (probably virtual) to 
get rid of any serious misunderstandings that may be there early. 
Surely, we can meet at LPC and/or KVM-forum as well to discuss even more.

Thank you very much for your openness and your constructive, honest
feedback.
